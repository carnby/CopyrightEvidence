Despite substantial growth in availability, choice sets have not converged across countries; and observers point to copyright-related transaction costs as an obstacle to greater availability. Policy makers are now contemplating various copyright reforms that could reduce these trade costs. The possibility of these changes raises the question of how much benefit they would create for consumers and producers around the world. We address these questions with a structural model of supply and demand for music in 17 countries, which we employ to counterfactually simulate the effect of a European digital single market (the equivalent of a pan-European copyright regime) on the welfare of consumers and producers. We also simulate autarky and worldwide frictionless trade - in which all products are available in all countries - allowing us to quantify both the conventional gains from status quo trade as well as the maximum possible gains available to free trade. Existing and additional trade have different patterns of benefit to consumers and producers. Status quo trade benefits consumers everywhere, but European consumers have benefited more than North Americans. Existing trade has had large benefits to American producers but on balance small benefits to European producers. Additional trade would continue the pattern of consumers benefits with larger gains to European consumers but would reverse the pattern for producers. Greater availability of products resulting from easing of copyright restrictions would raise per capita gains to producers in Europe more than in North America.

In addition, grant permission for some responses also had a significantly higher mean response time than grant permission to all responses\n\n* Approximately 120 days after the initial request, there are diminishing returns, no matter the type of copyright holder.

Of all of the responses from rights holders, 679 (91%) were to grant the Library permission to display all items requested in permissions letters. Only 46 (6%) of the responses were refuse all.

This fact, in conjunction with data that show that if there is no response after approximately four months, there is likely not to be one at all, might encourage archivists to place limits on the length of time they invest in the process\n\n* Because so much time is required to contact and negotiate with rights holders, spending that time on rights holders with many documents in a collection yields more than spending time seeking permission from rights holders with just one or two items in a collection. \n\n* Repositories might only be able to display a small portion of collections with many corporate third party rights holders", "url": "http://www.copyrightevidence.org/evidence-wiki/index.php/Akmon_(2010)", "type": "Study", "government_or_policy": 0, "abstract": "Archival repositories are increasingly considering mass digitization as a means of meeting user expectations that materials be available online, remotely.

National duration idiosyncrasies thus survive into the post-harmonisation era \u2013 a single European term of protection remains very much a chimera.  \n\n*Without proper EU harmonisation of the term of protection the same subject matter might receive a drastically different term of protection depending on the country within which protection is sought, increasing the complexity of the calculation of the duration of copyright and related rights in Europe 27 times over. This fragmented state of affairs is maladjusted to the challenges of the digital world: although from a legal point of view the public domain may still be conceived of as multiple separate country-specific entities, with the advent of online exploitation the use of a work is envisaged as taking place simultaneously across borders.61 Territoriality, a cornerstone of traditional copyright law, does not tally with the look and feel of the internet.\n\n*Diverse national rules make the calculation of the term of protection excessively difficult. European cross-border digitisation projects such as Europeana may wish to signal the public domain status of holdings to their users, but which is the relevant public domain? If a work has no set copyright status, marking it online as definitively free to use becomes treacherous.

The semi-harmonisation achieved thus far has narrowed the autonomy of Member States in the area of the term of protection, providing some superficial approximation. The devil of disharmonisation however persists in the details of term harmonisation. If the EU wishes to establish a truly harmonised term of protection for copyright and related rights, a more committed and comprehensive approach will be a necessary. Some of the identified harmonisation gaps can be filled with a stricter European harmonisation policy intolerant of national oddities. Others, such as those caused by transitional provisions or international obligations granting terms of protection longer than those foreseen in the Directive, will not be eliminated for decades. However, disparities in the conceptual framework of copyright can only be overcome with the harmonisation of European substantive copyright law. In its recent Communication on a Single Market for Intellectual Property Rights the Commission broached the idea of a far-reaching overhaul of copyright at the European level through the creation of a European Copyright Code. Challenging as the execution of this proposal might be politically, such a code would go a long way to ensuring legal certainty for European citizens.", "url": "http://www.copyrightevidence.org/evidence-wiki/index.php/Angelopoulos_(2012)", "type": "Study", "government_or_policy": 1, "abstract": "The term of protection of copyright and related rights is generally considered to be one of the best harmonised areas of European copyright law.

In this report, four main sources of legislative variability are identified and analysed: a) contagion from unharmonised areas of substantive copyright law; b) explicit exceptions to the harmonisation of the term of protection; c) national related rights of unharmonised term; and d) incorrect implementation of the provisions of the Term Directive into national law. As a result, the desired harmonising effect has not been fully achieved: although a single rule may be applicable across the EU in theory, drastically divergent terms of protection may attach to the same information product depending on the jurisdiction within which protection is sought. In this way, the territorial nature of copyright undercuts harmonisation efforts, forcing the public domain to contract and expand according to divergent national rules. The result is a legislative framework that makes cross-border rights clearance calculation difficult, hampering end-users and cultural heritage organisations from taking full avail of the new opportunities now technically available for the digitisation and exploitation of the public domain.

In practice, these contracts may or may not provide for complete or partial transfer(s) to the sports organisers of the copyrights and neighbouring rights in the audiovisual recording and transmission of the event. Sports events organisers or their federations may, alternatively, elect to produce and distribute media coverage of the sports events themselves. Either way, the combination of house right, media contract(s), and intellectual property protection of the audiovisual recording and broadcast effectively allows the sports event organisers to enjoy complete ownership and/or control over the audiovisual rights in the sports events.   \n\n* The integrity and financial benefits of a right to consent to bets can only be fully achieved when it is carefully managed by a national regulatory authority that:  \n1. actively prosecutes illegal betting services (including the offering of sports bets by licensed operators without the sports organisers\u2019 consent); 2. monitors the commercial exploitation of the right to consent to bets to prevent discriminatory or anti-competitive marketing conditions; 3. provides for an ex post mechanism for complaint handling and dispute resolution; 4. has the power to conduct on-going monitoring of the parties\u2019 compliance with the mutual rights and obligations contained in the contractual agreements. \n\n* The right of short news reporting is an important element of the EU legal order safeguarding the right of broadcasters to have access to \u201cevents of high interest to the public\u201d, such as important sports events, which are subject to exclusive broadcasting rights.

The \u201cno single buyer\u201d obligation, a remedy that was exceptionally imposed by the Commission in FAPL, is increasingly being emulated at the national level.

While in recent years distinct aspects of the problem have been addressed by legislatures and courts, both at the national and at the European level, a great deal of legal uncertainty persists. Divergent views on the appropriateness, form and scope of such legal protection exist among stakeholders and other concerned parties, reflecting the complex nature and multiple functions of sports in modern society. The universe of sports and media is a complex network of social and commercial relationships with a variety of stakeholders, each one of whom can claim rights or specific interests in the value chain of organizing and exploiting sports events, such as clubs, leagues, athletes, federations, fans, media content providers, sponsors, owners of sport facilities, sports betting operators and news media.  \n\nConsequently, the question of protecting sports events is by no means a one-dimensional legal issue, and should be framed in a broader socio-economic context. On the one hand, professional sport represents a large and fast-growing sector of the European economy \u2013 and in no small measure this is due to the commercial significance of sports media rights. On the other hand, sports are widely regarded as playing a pivotal role as a \u201csocial cohesive\u201d, an agent of communal, and conveyor of moral, values. This helps explain why major sports events qualify in various Member States as \u201cevents of major importance\u201d for society, subject to special media rules mitigating exclusive rights of broadcasters to guarantee viewers\u2019 access to these events via free-to-air television.  \n\nThe general objective of this study is to examine and critically assess a number of the most pressing questions of substantive law relating to the existence and exercise of sports organisers' rights in the EU. The specific objectives of the study are:  \n\uf0b7 To map the legal framework applicable to the origin and ownership of sports organisers' rights in the 28 Member States; \uf0b7 To analyse the nature and scope of sports organisers' rights with regard to licensing practices in the field of the media, taking into account relevant EU law provisions; \uf0b7 To examine the possibility of establishing licensing practices beyond the media field, notably in the area of gambling and betting; \uf0b7 To provide recommendations on the opportunity of EU action to address any problem that may be identified in the above mentioned areas of analysis.", "entities": ["Free-to-air", "Substantive_law", "European_Commission", "Legal_certainty", "Qualitative_research", "Virtual_advertising", "GeneRally", "European_Union_law", "Gambling", "European_Union", "The_Divergent_Series", "Sports_betting"], "country": ["Australia", "Austria", "Belgium", "Bulgaria", "Croatia", "Cyprus", "Czech Republic", "Denmark", "Estonia", "Finland", "France", "Germany", "Greece", "Hungary", "Ireland", "Italy", "Latvia", "Lithuania", "Luxembourg", "Malta", "Netherlands", "Poland", "Portugal", "Romania", "Slovakia", "Slovenia", "Spain", "Sweden", "United Kingdom"], "authentic_link": "http://ec.europa.eu/sport/news/2014/docs/study-sor2014-final-report-gc-compatible_en.pdf", "citation_count": null, "literature_review": 0, "industries": ["Programming and broadcasting", "Television programmes"], "disciplines": ["Entertainment \u2022 Media", "Sports \u2022 Gambling \u2022 Restaurants \u2022 Recreation \u2022 Tourism", "Government Policy", "Intellectual Property and Intellectual Capital"], "year": 2014.0, "label": "Study on Sports Organisers' Rights in the European Union", "policies": ["Licensing and Business models", "Fair remuneration"], "link": "http://ec.europa.eu/sport/news/2014/docs/study-sor2014-final-report-gc-compatible_en.pdf"}, {"collection_methods": ["Quantitative Collection Methods", "Survey Research (quantitative; e.g. sales/income reporting)", "Qualitative Collection Methods", "Survey Research (qualitative; e.g. consumer preferences)", "Semi-structured interview"], "data_description": "The study takes data from 24 cultural heritage institutions.", "analysis_methods": ["Quantitative Analysis Methods", "Quantitative content analysis (e.g. text or data mining)", "Qualitative Analysis Methods", "Textual Content Analysis"], "authors": "Astle and Muir (2002)", "issues": ["Relationship between protection", "Harmony of interest assumption between authors and publishers", "Effects of protection on industry structure"], "entity_count": {"Public_library": 1, "Digital_preservation": 1, "British_English": 1, "Library": 1}, "wordcount": {"preservation": 4, "Although": 1, "collections": 1, "holdings": 1, "material": 4, "traditional": 1, "questionnaire": 1, "copyright": 1, "conducted": 2, "digitization": 2, "potential": 1, "discussed": 1, "deal_with": 1, "rather_than": 1, "UK": 2, "relationship_between": 1, "surrounding": 1, "article_examines": 1, "digital": 1, "public": 2, "in_terms": 1, "financial": 1, "aspects": 1, "largely": 1, "access": 4, "libraries": 2, "also": 1, "little": 1, "library": 1, "done": 1, "portion": 1, "was_found": 1, "survey": 1, "issues": 3, "technical": 1, "survey_was": 1, "digitization_projects": 3, "increased": 1, "archives": 2, "range": 1, "to_determine": 1, "impact": 1, "driven": 1, "digitized": 2, "experiences": 1, "original": 2, "restrictions": 1, "main": 1, "to_ensure": 1, "user": 1, "related": 1, "funding": 2, "demand": 1, "significantly": 1, "article": 1, "full": 1, "selection": 1, "small": 1}, "plain_text_proposition": "The opinion amongst those surveyed is very much that funding sources for digitization and for preservation are distinctly separate, and therefore one does not affect the other.\nHowever comments made by the respondents verified that tensions do exist over the levels of funding available for each activity. The survey highlighted just how little is spent on\npreservation in many libraries and archives and that typically preservation needs are seen as much larger than budgets can cater for.\nAlthough the data on financial issues was far from comprehensive, this in itself tends to indicate a general lack of awareness concerning project costs. However, having allowed for the incomplete nature of the data, two points are tentatively made. The impact of major grant\nfunding has been to virtually halt digitization projects in public libraries and archives during the last two years, and the majority of digitization projects have generated no significant\nrevenue.\nThe widespread promotion of preservation (after access) as a major benefit following digitization does not appear to be widely supported by the subsequent actions in public libraries and archives. The two ways in which digitization is said to improve preservation, a fall in demand\nto see original material and the imposition of access restrictions, have not been universally seen or adopted.\nThe level of awareness that libraries and archives in general have concerning the problems of digital preservation, must have risen to some degree given their exposure to the standards in the nof-digitise programme. However, libraries and archives have been slow to adopt preservation\npolicies and none of those surveyed include digitization in their policy.\nThere is also a distinct lack of urgency in considering migration as a strategy for digital preservation.

Libraries and archives must budget for the whole life cycle of the digitization process and not just for image capture.\nThe survey has shown that following digitization, demand for access to original material does not necessarily\ndecline. Libraries and archives should consider automatically placing restrictions on access to original materials where appropriate. This would improve preservation at little cost to the beleaguered budgets identified by many respondents, and would be consistent with using preservation as a selection criterion.\nUntil a formal preservation policy is in place, any attempt to raise significant funding for preservation activities is unlikely to succeed. Having a preservation policy is now a common requisite for the consideration of applications by funding bodies.\nDigitization should be included in that policy, even if no projects are currently planned. It will help increase awareness of digital preservation issues and will highlight the preservation aspects of digitization, rather than those that exclusively concern access.\nResearch is needed into how strategies for acquiring and preserving digital material can be developed specifically for the public library sector as a whole. Without this it is likely that strategy development will be slow and unco-ordinated.\nThere is also a need for research into robust models of the costs of digitization that take into account preservation issues.", "url": "http://www.copyrightevidence.org/evidence-wiki/index.php/Astle_and_Muir_(2002)", "type": "Study", "government_or_policy": 0, "abstract": "This article examines the relationship between access and preservation in digitization projects conducted by public libraries and archives in the UK.

A questionnaire survey was conducted of 20 UK public libraries and archives to determine their experiences related to the above issues. It was found that few digitization projects realized their full potential in terms of preserving original material, and so little has been done to ensure the preservation of the digitized material. Although access is significantly increased, the range of material that has been digitized is very narrow and is driven largely by copyright restrictions rather than user demand.

The review included a call for interested party submissions and intergovernmental agency consultations.\nCopyright is a form of intellectual property that protects the rights of creators in certain original forms of expression, including photographs and cinematograph films. It rewards creative effort, and economic investment in creative effort, by granting a number of exclusive economic rights. These rights provide an incentive to encourage the generation and flow of new material to the public. One of the core rights granted by copyright is the right to prevent other persons from copying a work. While copyright does not guarantee a proportionate return for the work involved, the ability to require other persons to pay for copying can give creators and investors some security for the skill, time and resources necessary to produce new works.\nThe Act also provides many exceptions which limit the scope of copyright. These exceptions are an integral part of copyright, recognising that in some circumstances the usual rights of copyright owners should not apply.

Importantly, unlike fair use, this exception can only apply to a use of copyright material for one of the prescribed purposes. The purposes are not illustrative.\n\nStatutory Licences\n*Recommendation 8\u20131 The Copyright Act should be amended to clarify that the statutory licences in pts VA, VB and VII div 2 do not apply to a use of copyright material which, because of another provision of the Act, would not infringe copyright.

The survey was designed to inform Industry Canada's policy development work and ultimately therefore support better policy decisions regarding the copyright law in Canada. In order to support its policy decisions regarding the copyright regime in Canada, Industry Canada commissioned a survey by Decima Research in 2006 which was designed to measure the extent to which peer to peer (P2P) file-sharing activities act as substitutes or complements to music purchases. Given this purpose the Decima survey asked respondents to comment on their behaviour in the absence of P2P file-sharing, as follows:\n\nConsidering the songs that you downloaded for free through P2P networks during 2005\na) what % would you have purchased at paid music sites if they were not available through P2P\nb) what % would you have purchased as part of a music CD if they were not available through P2P\n\nAfter analyzing the answers to this question, I report on two key findings:\n1. three out of every four respondents said that if P2P were not available they would have purchased some or all of the music which they downloaded; and\n2. almost two-thirds of the hardcore P2P downloaders (those who indicated in the survey that they only acquired music by P2P) said they would have purchased one-third of the tracks they downloaded if the songs were not available on P2P network. This is estimated to amount to an average additional expense of $168 per person, adding up to hundreds of millions of dollars in extra revenue for the music industry per year from this group alone.\n\nThis analysis of survey data then suggests that P2P downloads have strong negative effects on legitimate music purchases and that P2P downloading acts as a substitute for legitimate music purchases.

These studies in effect attempt to challenge the approach of the WIPO and assert that exceptions to copyright law might make a larger economic contribution than copyright law itself. \n\nThe Computer & Communications Industry Association (CCIA) CCIA issued the first of these \u201ccopyright exceptions\u201d or \u201cfair use\u201d studies in 2007, under taken by Capital Trade Inc (CT) which purported to measure CEI in the US during the period 2002-2006. CCIA has since commissioned CT to update this study in the US twice, first in 2010 , and then in 2011. In 2010 the CCIA further commissioned a study of the European Union (EU) this time by SEO Economic Research which adapted and applied the same approach used by CT in the US. Recently in September 2012 the Australian Digital Alliance (ADA) similarly commissioned and released two reports written by Lateral Economics (LE) that adapted and applied the methodology used in the US and EU to Australia.\n\nWe focus our critique in this paper primarily on the LE Australian study as it is the most recent attempt to measure copyright exceptions by applying the methodology developed in the US. Our critique of the LE approach however can be readily generalised to the older US and EU studies.\n\nThe main conclusions of the LE study of Australia we shall focus on then are that:\n\n*\u201cflexible copyright \u2018exceptions\u2019 and better crafted \u2018safe harbours\u2019 would make a substantial contribution to Australia\u2019s economic growth and innovation with negligible downsides for rights holders; and\n\n*the recommended changes would improve productivity growth.

First we corrected for the fact AF biased their results by excluding from their analysis the group of consumers who had completely stopped purchasing CD\u2019s (potentially because of P2P activity) prior to 2005. This is the very group who were most responsive, or likely to have substituted P2P downloading for CD purchases. Second we controlled for the fact that the level of an individual\u2019s demand for CD\u2019s, and the level of an individual\u2019s P2P downloading may be correlated simply because they are both affected by the same third factor, such as love of music, so that high (or low) levels of CD demand is likely to be associated with high (low) levels of P2P demand. Such a positive association between the level of demand and level of P2P downloading may have led AF to mistakenly conclude they had found evidence of a positive market creation effect, as AF regressed the level of individuals CD demand against the level of individuals P2P downloading. Instead we focused on the changes in CD demand and changes in P2P downloading, using data in the survey that AF ignored on 2004 and 2005 behaviours of participants. By focusing on a longitudinal analysis of how the change in individual P2P downloading behaviour affected the change in CD demand we were better able to isolate the true relationship between increases or changes in P2P downloading and changes in CD demand.", "comparative": 0, "intervention_response": "This report examines data on the effects of Internet peer-to-peer (P2P) file sharing activities on music purchasing which were obtained from a survey commissioned by Industry Canada.

Unlike other media industries, the TV format industry has developed mechanisms to cope with this situation, without having to rely too much on format protection. Beyond a core protection against close format imitation, format developers and broadcasters, who are often both innovators and imitators, benefit from a regime of free-format appropriability, as this enables them to allocate profitability risk across the industry and to cope with uncertainty of demand.

New game show, casting, soap, telenovela, documentary and other formats are sold to broadcasting stations in dozens of countries, leading to a worldwide multi-billion dollar industry. As an analysis of U.S. and European intellectual property law demonstrates, TV show formats are difficult to protect by intellectual property law. Standard theory would predict that in the absence of intellectual property protection, the TV show format industry has insufficient incentives to invest in creative innovation. This article presents a novel theory to explain why the TV show format market is thriving despite a low level of format protection. On the supply side of the industry, demand for TV show formats is hard to predict, return on them is highly skewed, and market participants are both developing original formats and imitating others\u2019 formats. On the demand side, TV show formats are experience goods, and TV viewers sometimes prefer familiar products. As a result, the TV show format market is subject to herding effects on both sides of the market. The interaction of supply-side and demand-side herding leads to fashion cycles in TV show formats.

This suggest that ex ante unknown artists are likely to see more positive overall effects of file sharing than ex ante popular artists are.\n\n* Furthermore, the differential effect of file sharing on the sales of artists of different levels of ex ante popularity has led to a dramatic shift in the distribution of sales among artists, as new and less popular artists are now selling more records while star artists have seen their sales shrink, compacting the distribution of outcomes.", "comparative": 0, "intervention_response": "The RIAA\u2019s strategy of suing individual file sharing users leads to reduced file sharing activity and sizeable increases in sales.", "url": "http://www.copyrightevidence.org/evidence-wiki/index.php/Blackburn_(2004)", "type": "Study", "government_or_policy": 0, "abstract": "Ever since the introduction of Napster, the impact of file sharing on the music industry has been the focus of intense debate. The availability of songs on file sharing networks has two competing effects on sales that are likely to vary across artists.\nFirst, there is a direct substitution effect on sales as some consumers download rather\nthan purchase music. Second, there is a penetration effect which increases sales, as the spread of an artist\u2019s works helps to make the artist more well-known throughout the population. The first effect is strongest for ex ante well-known artists, while the second is strongest for ex ante unknown artists. Thus file sharing reduces sales for well-known artists relative to unknown artists. Taking account of this heterogeneity in estimating the effect of file sharing provides strong evidence of this distributional effect. Additionally, I find a large aggregate negative effect on sales not apparent in previous work that failed to account for the differential impacts on more and less wellknown artists. The overall negative impact of file sharing arises because aggregate sales are dominated by sales of well-known artists. Using my estimates of the effect of file sharing, counterfactual exercises suggest that the lawsuits brought by the RIAA have resulted in an increase in album sales of approximately 2.9% during the 23 week period after the lawsuit strategy was publicly announced. Furthermore, if files available on-line were reduced across the board by 30%, industry sales would have been approximately 10% higher in 2003.", "entities": ["Data_set", "Counterfactual_conditional", "File_sharing", "Recording_Industry_Association_of_America", "Napster"], "country": ["United States of America"], "authentic_link": null, "citation_count": 10.0, "literature_review": 0, "industries": ["Sound recording and music publishing"], "disciplines": ["Regulation and Business Law", "Technological Change \u2022 Research and Development \u2022 Intellectual Property Rights", "Intellectual Property and Intellectual Capital"], "year": 2004.0, "label": "A study of on-line piracy and recorded music sales", "policies": ["Licensing and Business models", "Enforcement"], "link": "http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.117.2922&rep=rep1&type=pdf"}, {"collection_methods": null, "data_description": "", "analysis_methods": null, "authors": "Blackburn (2005)", "issues": null, "entity_count": {}, "wordcount": null, "plain_text_proposition": null, "comparative": 0, "intervention_response": null, "url": "http://www.copyrightevidence.org/evidence-wiki/index.php/Blackburn_(2005)", "type": "Study", "government_or_policy": 0, "abstract": "", "entities": [], "country": null, "authentic_link": null, "citation_count": null, "literature_review": 0, "industries": null, "disciplines": null, "year": 2005.0, "label": "Essays on the economics of copying with an application to the recorded music industry", "policies": null, "link": null}, {"collection_methods": ["Focus Groups"], "data_description": "This project engaged rights holders and users in a review of the copyright system to help set an agenda for future copyright policy.\n\nFour copyright areas were explored: access to works; recognition around creative input; incentivising investment and creativity; and authenticating and protecting works.\n\nTwo waves of research were held in London, Manchester, Glasgow and Cardiff between 3rd and 12th March 2009.\n\nA total of 83 participants took part, from the following groups: members of the public; small to medium sized enterprises (SMEs) comprising users as well as those engaged in rights clearance processes; and representatives from the creative industries.

The dependent variable of the study was legal vs illegal downloading of music. A 20-item questionnaire was completed by 84 respondents. The final four questions in the study were guilt-inducing questions(which the respondent was informed of in compliance with ethical primary research); the remainder of the questions were neutral in nature.\n\nFindings \u2013 The paper finds that the respondents illegally download despite viewing the act as immoral. Respondents choose to morally disengage from the non-ethical nature of the act in an attempt to avoid feeling guilty about illegal downloading and also to avoid any blame being attributed to them personally. Many respondents feel the act of illegal downloading is simply today\u2019s reality and that there is nothing wrong or immoral about illegal downloading. Those who illegally download were less likely to attack the activity for being wrong. Active music fans were more likely to engage in illegal downloading than passive ones. Being a student versus being gainfully employed did not affect downloading behaviour.\n\nResearch limitations/implications \u2013 A limitation of the study was the difficulty in getting people to disclose the truth about their own ethical violations.

Notice and take down approaches have been developed and streamlined in many countries to be very quick\n\n* In some cases, stakeholders have also raised concerns that notice and take down regimes merely displace hosting activity to other countries (c.f. the Dutch case)5 days in the Netherlands; 12 to 35 days in Italy, 15 days in Spain) and inexpensive\n\n* Demand-side action requires new legislation to be brought into place (15 years in Brazil, 5 years in the UK). These measures are contentious,  bringing rights holders into conflict with both ISPs and civil liberties / consumer groups and NGOs.\n\n* Only Brazil and the Netherlands have dismissed the option of setting up new structures or processes to deal with the phenomenon of online copyright infringement. This suggests one or both of the following, that:\na) existing legal powers and institutions were ill-equipped to deal with the scale and speed of the phenomenon of online copyright enforcement; and\nb) creating new laws and institutions has a \u2018signalling\u2019 effect to both domestic and international stakeholders that shows that the issue is being taken seriously\n\n*  The presence of dedicated regulation and legislation has, in several countries, prompted both:\na) The establishment of voluntary measures as part of the overall set-up (e.g. CAS in US, which helps protect ISPs from law suits or in lieu of a fully worked out implementation (as in the UK, where Creative Content UK has been set up in light of the delays in the implementation of the DEA); and\nb) The emergence of market-based solutions in some areas: e.g. services to provide due diligence for advertisers (e.g. White Bullet in the UK and the Internet Advertising Bureau in IT)\n\n*  WIPO takes a similar view to the Commission in thinking that the most effective enforcement mechanism in the medium to long term will be the development of a competitive legal online content market", "comparative": 1, "intervention_response": "* The authours conclude that where good levels of cooperation and joint working between ISPs and rights holders can be established (most obviously through voluntary agreements), this can remove much of the friction that otherwise exists in dealing with online copyright enforcement.

This has certainly been the experience of WIPO, who organised a seminar on the role of internet intermediaries vis-\u00e0-vis tackling infringement back in 2005.

The online criminal provisions of CDPA 1988 are hardly being used, if at all. There has been a lack of clarity over how they can be applied, and even if this is addressed, they will not provide access to appropriate and proportionate sentences for serious infringement cases. If no change is made, this problem will continue.\n\nii. There is a case for increasing sanctions relating to online offences, especially if the civil case law is believed to have developed to a point where prosecutions can now be brought successfully against criminal activity. However, safeguards may be needed to ensure that ordinary members of the public and those whose copying is not motivated by a criminal intent are not inadvertently caught by any amended provision. Also, there must be a proportionate approach that permits legitimate experimentation.\n\niii. Custodial sentences in excess of two years have been used for physical copying offences. While no evidence was found of sanctions exceeding five years, the available data does not provide a basis for concluding that the level of physical penalties is inappropriate \u2013 it is rare to have the maximum sentence applied to any such crime, but important to have the means to establish a scale of offending.\n\niv. There is logic to placing serious online copyright offences into a more serious category, which soundings taken for this study equate with a maximum sentence of at least five years. The precedents within the IP landscape are either to leave offences outside the criminal justice system altogether (as in the case of patents) or to set a maximum offence on conviction at ten years.

Copyright and patent laws do this by providing qualifying authors and inventors with a bundle of exclusive rights relating to the use and development of their creations. Importantly, however, these fields differ greatly in the ways that they determine whether some new creation is sufficiently innovative to merit legal protection. Copyright law sets the creativity bar especially low for new works of authorship, whereas patent law demands that a putative inventor prove that her creation is highly innovative. Relatively little research has focused on whether the different IP thresholds affect the incentives and behavior of creators.\n\nLegal scholarship on the effects of differing IP thresholds on creators has generally relied on standard economic assumptions about the way that people respond to incentives. Creators are assumed to be rational and to respond to increased incentives by producing more and better creations. According to this reasoning, because patent law requires more creativity as a precondition to the conferral of IP rights compared to what copyright law requires, creators subject to the patent regime will be encouraged to be more creative than those subject to the copyright regime.\n\nRecent research in the social sciences, however, suggests that the connection between incentives and behavior \u2014 particularly with regard to creativity \u2014 is not always so straightforward. Although some research indicates that providing incentives to act creatively has the expected effect of increasing creativity, other research suggests that offering certain types of incentives can undermine creative behavior. For example, monetary incentives to perform creative tasks may dampen creativity. Moreover, and importantly for our purposes, increasing the magnitude of an incentive to be creative may not always lead to more or better behavior. Once creativity incentives are sufficiently salient or intense, there is a risk that people will be overly focused on achieving the incentive and \u201cchoke.\u201d\n\nIn the series of experiments reported in this Article, we extend the research on the effects of incentives for creativity into the realm of intellectual property. Specifically, we test whether the existence of a creativity threshold that conditions entry into a prize lottery on meeting certain performance standards affects how creative people are. The experiments reported here involve various creativity tasks in which subjects are randomly assigned to conditions that are intended to model the different creativity thresholds employed by copyright and patent law. Doing so allows us to test whether the existence and nature of a threshold increases, decreases, or does not affect subjects\u2019 creativity.\n\nThis research contributes to the growing debates about whether copyright law\u2019s creativity threshold is set too low and should be increased and whether patent law\u2019s creativity threshold is appropriately set.

On the other side of the Atlantic, however, many European countries give creators, at least in their copyright laws, much stronger rights to attribution. At first blush it may seem that the U.S. has gotten it wrong, and the Europeans have made a better policy choice in providing to creators a right that they value. But for reasons we will explain in this Article, matters are a lot more complicated than that. \n\nThis Article reports a series of experiments that are the first to attempt to quantitatively measure the value of attribution to creators. In previous research, we have shown that creators of IP are subject to a \u201ccreativity effect\u201d that results in them assigning substantially higher value to their works than neoclassical economic theory predicts. The first two experiments reported in this Article suggest a way that the creativity effect may be reduced \u2013 creators are willing to sacrifice significant economic payments in favor of receiving attribution for their work. The value to creators of attribution raises the question whether U.S. IP law should be re-structured to provide attribution as a creator\u2019s default right. \n\nThe third and most important experiment reported here casts doubt on the value of giving creators such a default right, because creators value attribution differently depending on whether the legal rule gives it to them as an initial entitlement or not. When creators are given a right to attribution as a default they value credit four times higher than when attribution is not the default option. Our findings make clear that creators value attribution, and that the prospect of obtaining it can lead to a more efficient level of transacting. At the same time, and paradoxically, our findings also suggest that before we restructure American law, which provides no right to attribution for the vast majority of creators, we need to take care, because it is possible, under conditions that we will describe, that providing creators with a default right to attribution will result in less efficient transacting. \n\nFinally, our findings have important implications for property theory which are broader than IP law or attribution rights. Our third experiment suggests that a party who enjoys a default legal right as part of her initial complement of rights will tend to treat that legal right in a fashion similar to any other form of initial entitlement, and overvalue it relative to what neoclassical theory would predict. This suggests a principle regarding how to efficiently structure default rules in any setting. All other factors being equal, an efficiently-structured default rule will locate the initial legal entitlement in the party who is either less likely to overvalue the entitlement, or, if overvaluation seems inevitable regardless of where the initial entitlement is placed, is likely to overvalue it less.", "entities": ["Intellectual_property", "The_Atlantic", "Creativity", "Law_of_the_United_States", "Amazon_Mechanical_Turk", "Neoclassical_economics", "VAST"], "country": ["United States of America"], "authentic_link": "http://scholarship.kentlaw.iit.edu/fac_schol/733/", "citation_count": null, "literature_review": 0, "industries": ["Creative, arts and entertainment"], "disciplines": ["General Economics", "Role of Economics \u2022 Role of Economists \u2022 Market for Economists", "Law and Economics", "Basic Areas of Law", "Property Law", "Technological Change \u2022 Research and Development \u2022 Intellectual Property Rights", "Intellectual Property and Intellectual Capital"], "year": 2012.0, "label": "Making Sense of Intellectual Property Law", "policies": ["Fair remuneration"], "link": "http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1919210"}, {"collection_methods": ["Quantitative Collection Methods", "Survey Research (quantitative; e.g. sales/income reporting)", "Web analytic (online user trace data)"], "data_description": "For study 1, the authors compiled a list of bestselling novels that were published in the decade before (1913-22) and the decade after (1923-32): the copyright-public domain divide.

It is true that criminal sanctions could play an important role in preventing harmful\nbehavior that cannot be deterred through other means. But imposing criminal sanctions is costly.

Civil sanctions will probably be sufficient for creating the optimal amount of infringing behavior. For copyright infringement, civil sanctions alone should be sufficient to deter nearly all types of harmful conduct. There is an economic case for imposing criminal sanctions for copyright infringement only with respect to a discrete set of activities: massive reproduction and sales of commercially valuable works. We have arrived at the conclusion that the case for criminal IP sanctions is weak or nonexistent while putting to one side both noneconomic considerations, such as moral or deontological objections to criminal IP sanctions, and economic concerns about the efficacy of IP in promoting innovation. Once those considerations are added to the calculus, we suspect that the argument for criminal sanctions for IP infringement will disintegrate almost entirely.", "comparative": 1, "intervention_response": "Many IP stakeholders and scholars have operated under the assumption that there is an economic case for criminal IP sanctions.

Traditional conceptions of the value of IP rely on assumptions about human rationality derived from classical economics. The law assumes that when people make decisions about buying, selling, and licensing IP they do so with fixed, context-independent preferences. Over the past several decades, this rational actor model of classical economics has come under attack by behavioral data showing that people do not always make strictly rational decisions. Perhaps the most important research in this field is that related to the \u201cendowment effect\u201d \u2013 the discovery that, contrary to economic predictions, people value the same object more when they own it than when they do not. \n\nTo date, the endowment effect has been observed for a variety of goods including mugs, lottery tickets, and hunting permits. Our experiment establishes a substantial valuation asymmetry between authors of poems and potential purchasers of them. As we explain in detail in the article, we constructed a market for the poems that was modeled on a market for licensing IP. The observed differences in valuation indicate that IP licensing markets may be substantially less efficient that previously believed. Our results suggest that (1) the preferences of IP creators, owners, and purchasers are unstable and dependent on the initial distribution of property rights in creative works, and (2) large gaps arise between purchasers\u2019 willingness to pay and sellers\u2019 willingness to accept even though the poems are non-rival property and the contemplated alienation of the property is therefore only partial. \n\nOur findings suggest that private transactions in creative goods may face significant transaction costs arising from cognitive biases that drive the price that creators and owners of IP are likely to demand for transfers considerably higher than what buyers will, on average, be willing to pay. This does not mean, of course, that transactions in IP will not take place \u2013 we see such transactions happening out in the world every day. Our research suggests, however, that IP transactions may occur at a level that is significantly suboptimal, and that the baleful effect of cognitive and affective biases is likely to be more serious for transactions in works of relatively low commercial value, or for which no well-established custom or pattern helps to inform valuation. These results have considerable implications for the structuring of IP rights, IP formalities, IP licensing, and fair use.", "entities": ["Intellectual_property", "Lottery", "Organizational_culture", "Financial_endowment", "Classical_economics", "Cognitive_bias", "Transaction_cost", "Rational_choice_theory"], "country": ["United States of America"], "authentic_link": "http://scholarship.law.cornell.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=3184&context=clr", "citation_count": 1.0, "literature_review": 0, "industries": ["Creative, arts and entertainment", "Publishing of books, periodicals and other publishing"], "disciplines": ["Entertainment \u2022 Media", "Innovation and Invention: Processes and Incentives", "Intellectual Property and Intellectual Capital"], "year": 2010.0, "label": "Valuing intellectual Property: An Experiment", "policies": ["Fair remuneration"], "link": "http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1568962"}, {"collection_methods": ["Quantitative Collection Methods", "Survey Research (quantitative; e.g. sales/income reporting)", "Qualitative Collection Methods"], "data_description": "Our measure of vertical R&D outsourcing is a dummy variable indicating whether \ufb01rms have\ncontracted third parties for R&D between 2005 and 2007.

All digital albums are allowed to be copied for personal use, as opposed to CD albums that cannot be copied. \n\n* In spite of this, digital music is associated with a lower price compared to a CD. Whether the lower price depends on the store, on the intangible nature of the product, or on the possibility to copy, cannot be determined due to the lack of variability in the explanatory variables. \n\n* As private copying for personal use is widespread and allowed in the UK, it is plausible that private copying is already largely or fully priced in the UK market. Consumers and producers of music appear to expect that music will be copied for personal non-commercial use and all downloads are sold on these terms.\n\nFilm\n\n* In parallel with traditional films, which come with only one license (e.g. Blu-Ray and DVD), the film industry has found different ways to allow users to have more than one copy of the films they purchase. Examples can be found in the sales of digital films (which could be copied onto a number devices), by bundling multiple formats in the same package (which may also include a complimentary downloadable digital copy), or through new kinds of licenses, such as Ultraviolet. \n\n* The study found a positive relationship between price and film copies. In particular, since different types of formats have different impacts on price, we can conclude that film stores charge users not simply to have more copies, but to have the opportunity to choose from a higher variety of available choices.\n\nBooks\n\n* All the bookstores in the sample allow users to make copies of their eBooks. In particular, the copying terms and conditions are enforced using technologies embedded in the eBooks (DRMs) which are able to limit the number of copies that users is allowed and the kinds of devices in which the eBooks may be read on (e.g. smartphones, tablets, eBook readers). \n\n* The influence of the number of copies allowed and the number of allowable devices on the price could not be determined because (1) of the lack of variability in the explanatory variables, and (2) to the fact that the large majority of price dissimilarities were captured by the difference between traditional books and eBooks. \n\n* However, when considering that they are allowed to be copied, eBooks are on average less expensive than physical books (which are not allowed to be copied). This premium for a physical book is of course likely to be explained by manufacturing costs and the value consumers place on physical features, rather than on the number of copies that can be made from it.\n\nSoftware\n\n* This market case was used partly as a control case as it would notionally not be affected by a private copying exception.

Museums and rightholders should cooperate to ensure that they get a fair return in the subsequent exploitation of the artwork by third party operators.\n\n. Museums should also negotiate with the various stakeholders and in particular with academics, artists and collective management organisations to update licenses and tariffs, to ease the acquisition of permissions and to anticipate new uses that may need authorisation. Joint action of museums would enhance their negotiation position and help draw a blue print where the lawmakers may not have set applicable rules or even figured out the stakes. Statements of the museums community on thumbnail images could provide some guidance, more will be needed with digital humanities and 3D printing as well as with crowdfunding.\n\n3. Cooperation between museums should be encouraged and those more experienced could provide useful guidance to fellow museums through the aegis of ICOM and project partnerships.\n\nRecommendations to the lawmakers\n\n1. Digitization of collections appears to be an inescapable step to fulfill their primary mandates of preservation and communication to the public for information on heritage resources to be visited.\nIn this respect, rules on digitization of artwork held in the permanent collection of a museum, whether or not orphan works, for preservation purposes, could be clarified and harmonized as exceptions or limitations. Digitization of unpublished works could follow the same rule as for orphan works, e.g. prior due diligence to locate rightholders and seek consent and disclosure only for legitimate reasons of public interest. Consultation on museums\u2019 websites (with restricted downloading) of the permanent collections, catalogues and archives could also be addressed as a limitation subject to the rightholder\u2018s consent and standard compensation.\n\n2. The territoriality of rights and the difficulty associated with clearing rights in different territories is a long-enduring situation, which copyright collective management entities know well. They have indeed entered into reciprocal agreements with sister organisations to ease the licensing of copyright. Still there is no overall licensing framework for international exhibitions and the scope of the required authorisations for digital transmissions is not all that clear: differentiating acts of reproduction and communication to the public is not easy. Furthermore, \u201ccommunication to the public/ making available\u201d is not explicitly defined in content, location and effect, notably regarding spin off effects on image search services which operate to some extent like image banks and the implications of hyperlinking towards copyrighted works.\n\n3. Education, research and study are often collaborative and cross-border activities. There are Creative Common licenses for these purposes which museums can use for dissemination of their own copyrighted works. Yet, museums should develop their own policy to ensure the terms of a communication of their collections for research and study in accordance with their strategy, the requirement of non-commercial purposes and the development of text and data mining for instance.

Therefore retrospective term increases will have no effect upon the creation of new work.\n\n* Extension will increase the net present value of revenues for new works by 1% or less. While some authors argue that this small increase might, in some circumstances, result in a disproportionate reaction, nothing in the empirical evidence suggests that this is the case as regards current levels of production in the record industry.\n\n* Given the small size of this increase, the large number of works already being produced and the likely size of the deadweight loss (particularly in relation to historical works) it is our view that a term extension will likely result in a net loss to UK society as a whole.\n\n* Increasing copyright term increases revenues to the record industry. For retrospective extensions the 2% increase in the present value of revenues (being approximately 160 million pounds) suggested by PwC would seem plausible while for prospective extensions the figure would likely be 1% or lower. \n\n* Existing literature gives little indication as to how revenues would be distributed however our research did indicate that featured recording artists would likely benefit to some extent from such an extension with typical royalties rates around 5\u201315%.\n\n* Existing economic theory plausibly suggests that the extension of copyright term increases costs to consumers (consumers should be construed in a wide sense to include all users of recorded music including bars, film-makers, broadcasters etc). While the immediate cost of prospective extension is likely to be small, the immediate cost of an extension applied to existing works would likely be significant.\n\n* Increasing copyright term in the UK from 50 to 70 (or 95 years) is likely to have a significant, negative effect, on balance of trade.\n\n* The theoretical arguments that some incentive is required to induce publication, archiving and preservation activities in relation to old works seem to us to be plausible. However the review does not find that the need for such incentives would justify giving existing copyright holders an extended term of protection in the original work.\n\n* Modern systems of law regard the protection of established rights as fundamental. That is, once granted, modern legal systems rarely reduce existing entitlements. The effect of the principle of respect for established rights is that it is much easier to extend copyright term than to reduce it (so much so that term extensions are likely to be 'irreversible'). \n\n* If term were not extended and research over the next ten years showed this lack of extension to have been a mistake then it would be relatively easy to correct this error by introducing a term extension.", "comparative": 1, "intervention_response": "\\\"Any decision to extend term should be based on stronger evidence than one to keep term at its current level.\\\"\n\n\\\"Secondly, the prudent policy-maker faced with uncertainty should prefer a course of inaction so as to keep options open and await better and more precise data.

Furthermore, it cannot be established at present on the basis of theory alone whether exceptions should be broadened or narrowed down as a consequence of the expansion of the consumption possibilities of creative material (again brought about by technological advances). Nevertheless, there may be a case for exceptions in particular when they allow for the development of product qualities that a copyright owner could not produce herself due to transaction costs and technological constraints. Exceptions are also more likely justified in circumstances where hold-up problem risks introducing dynamic inefficiencies (in terms of suppressing incentives to invest).\n*Externalities potentially introduce a case for exceptions.

Copyright commentators, stakeholders with opposing interests, policy makers and academics have sometimes taken partial and diametrically opposing views in the debate.\n* Absent clearly identified and persistent market inefficiencies, exceptions are not likely to be warranted from an economic perspective.\n* Policy-makers should take a cautious approach when considering introducing new exceptions for such reasons: the market power of rightholders is limited by the inherent limitations in the scope (and length) of copyright protection and the availability of substitute creative work; and positive externalities may easily be exaggerated. Furthermore, with technological advances rightholders may increasingly be able to efficiently offer different, inferior versions of copyrighted work, obviating the rationale for the users to \u201cself-produce\u201d them. This means that the social loss due to market power, externalities, or productive inefficiencies, may not be as large as to justify the social costs of exceptions.\n* Social costs of exceptions predominantly manifest themselves in the form of reduced incentives for creative work and in the form of reduced incentives of the rightholders and distributors to provide access to existing and new work efficiently.

These mechanisms can be broadly categorised into three groups: (1) the use of vertical agreements to affect the interaction between parties within the vertical supply chain and between vertical supply chains, (2) price discrimination and (3) transaction costs.\n\n* Territorial licensing, as an instance of vertical agreements, could generate efficiencies by allowing the parties in vertical relationships to control for harmful externalities. However, it could also be used anti-competitively. The scope for efficiencies would appear to be significant in the relevant industries, and potential harmful effects, while possible, do not appear to be systemic. Therefore, policy changes which reduce the effectiveness of territorial licensing entail a risk of undermining the associated efficiencies which do not appear to be justified by the possibility to reduce the risk of harm.\n\n* Regarding price discrimination, our analysis suggests that there are potential benefits to static welfare that might flow from the proposed policy changes. However, we also find that, in scenarios which limit the ability to restrict territorial scope of licences, dynamic effects would likely negatively affect total social welfare. Our analysis suggests that, due to the importance of sunk costs in both the music and the audiovisual industries and due to the short life of these products, the weight put on preserving the dynamic incentives to invest in the production of creative content should be significant. Price discrimination in the audiovisual and music industries might then well be efficient overall. \n\n* It may indeed well be that the increase in transaction costs which results from territorial fragmentation of rights is an unavoidable side-effect of efficient licensing practices. A careful examination of the determinants of transaction cost reveals, perhaps counterintuitively, that some of the analysed policy changes designed to promote multi-territorial exploitation of content might result in an increase in transaction costs in comparison to the Status Quo. This is because in some of the scenarios legal and/or business uncertainty would likely increase.\n\n* The analysis of the four hypothetical scenarios favours the introduction of the country of origin principle while preserving the freedom of contracting (Scenario 2). This scenario could indeed reduce transaction costs while preserving the ability of the stakeholders to limit the territorial scope of their licences through appropriate contractual clauses. However, such conclusion is subject to a few important caveats.", "comparative": 0, "intervention_response": "The authors state  that changes to the licensing model could likely be adopted in response to the reform of the copyright framework and that such changes may also deny the gains that policy-makers hoped to achieve.\nHowever, they state that theory alone is unlikely to give strong predictions and that the relevant mechanisms discussed under the headings of Vertical Agreements and Price Discrimination often have ambiguous effect. Nevertheless, it can inform us about the sources of risks and potential benefits associated with the different policy options.", "url": "http://www.copyrightevidence.org/evidence-wiki/index.php/Charles_River_Associates_(2014)", "type": "Study", "government_or_policy": 0, "abstract": "In the European Union, the protection of copyright and related rights is territorial in the sense that these rights are provided by national laws and their geographical scope is limited to the territory of the state granting them. As a result, enforcement of rights occurs\non a country-by-country-basis. With respect to online on-demand uses of their creative works, authors of music and audiovisual works as well as holders of related rights enjoy an exclusive right of making their works available online to the public \u201cin such a way that members of the public can access them from a place and at a time individually chosen by them\u201d. In practice, online on-demand services also often involve a relevant act of reproduction of copyright protected works which entails the clearance of a second type of right, namely the reproduction right.\n\nSome stakeholders have suggested that the current copyright regime makes the clearance of rights for cross-border online uses an unnecessarily complex as well as resource-consuming process. Multinational service providers indeed often have to negotiate required rights separately for several territories since licensing content on a territory-by-territory basis (territorial licensing) appears to be a common practice in Europe. This arguably raises barriers to cross-border online access and prevents the online sphere from realising the full economic potential associated with the borderless nature of the internet.\n\nIn this report, we take territorial licensing as consisting of rightholders exercising the territorial nature of copyright by limiting the geographical scope of the rights granted to  licensee to a proper subset of EU Member States within a particular transaction. In line with this definition, the territorial nature of copyright is in itself not a sufficient condition for territorial licensing to take place. Indeed, the decisions of licensors to restrict the geographical scope of licences (i.e. to license on a territory-by-territory basis), are based on private motivations and depend on the wider institutional context, not only on the territorial nature of copyright. This report analyses the private motivations underlying the choice of territorial licensing in the current institutional framework in order, in a nutshell, to answer the following question: would a limitation to the practice of territorial licensing improve social welfare?

Music download, however, can also be interpreted as a value maximizing behavior that chooses between the values from consuming illicit and legitimate music, wherein the consumption value is partly dependent on one\u2019s degree of fashion involvement since music is fashionable. This paper presents a conceptual model of music download by looking at and integrating these seldom noticed perspectives with traditional explanations.

An increasing of the speed of internet and the high technologies of digital compression are factors that made a digital piracy happen easily. Moreover, the lower cost of hi-speed internet is the incentive of the software and digital media piracy occurrences. This is only one of many reasons which cause digital piracy. As Thailand was ranked 13th in the most software piracy in the world in 2003, there are a lot of concerns about the high increasing of the digital piracy in Thailand. This study focuses on one of the digital piracy model, and uses The Theory of Planned Behavior (TPB) as a based theory to determine the factors influencing software and digital piracy. Attitude, Subjective norms and Perceived Behavioral Control are the factors described in TPB as they affect to the intention to create the behavior. Past Behavior is another factor added in this study apart from TPB, which has an impact to the piracy intention. The digital piracy behavior model was developed in this study, and the five hypotheses were proposed. A survey is used to collect data for testing the constructs of the research. Almost four hundred people in Thailand were asked to answer the questionnaire which was developed from an effective guideline to examine the constructs in TPB. Attitude, subjective norms, perceived behavioral control and past behavior were found significantly to be predictors of digital piracy intention. Moreover, the digital piracy intention was a greatest determinant of digital piracy behavior as described in TPB. The implication of this study is to identify the digital piracy factors which relate to people's behavior and to model the digital piracy behavior framework for better understanding of digital piracy behavior. In addition, using the result of this research, a better understanding of the cause of the piracy intention emerges.

Of these mechanisms, however, patents tend to be the least emphasized by firms in the majority of manufacturing industries, and secrecy and lead time tend to be emphasized most heavily. A comparison of our results with the earlier survey findings of Levin et al. (1987) suggests that patents may be relied upon somewhat more heavily by larger firms now than in the early 1980s. For the protection of product innovations, secrecy now appears to be be much more heavily employed across most industries than previously. Our results on the motives for patent indicate that firms patent for reasons that often extend beyond directly profiting from a patented innovation through either its commercialization or licensing. In addition to the prevention of copying, the most prominent motives for patenting include the prevention of rivals from patenting related inventions (i.e., \\\"patent blocking\\\"), the use of patents in negotiations and the prevention of suits. We find that firms commonly patent for different reasons in \\\"discrete\\\" product industries, such as telecommunications equipment or semiconductors.

Introduced to stimulate the production of databases in Europe, the new instrument has had no proven impact on the production of databases. Data taken from the GDD (see Section 4.2.3) show that the EU database production in 2004 has fallen back to pre-Directive levels: the number of EU-based database \u201centries\u201d into the GDD6 was 3095 in 2004 as compared to 3092 in 1998. In 2001, there were 4085 EU-based \u201centries\u201d while in 2004 there were only 3095.\n\nIs \u201csui generis\u201d protection therefore necessary for a thriving database industry? The empirical\nevidence, at this stage, casts doubts on this necessity. The European publishing industry, which was consulted in a restricted online survey, however produced strong submissions arguing that \u201csui generis\u201d protection was crucial to the continued success of their activities. In addition, most respondents to the on-line survey (see Section 4.2.2) believe that the \u201csui generis\u201d right has brought about legal certainty, reduced the costs associated with the protection of databases, created more business opportunities and facilitated the marketing of databases.\n\nAt this stage, the evaluation concludes that repealing the Directive altogether or repealing the\n\u201csui generis\u201d right in isolation would probably lead to considerable resistance by the EU\ndatabase industry which wishes to retain \u201csui generis\u201d protection for factual compilations.

The aim of the Directive was to remove existing differences in the legal protection of databases by harmonising the rules that applied to copyright protection, safeguard the investment of database makers and ensure that the legitimate interests of users to access information compiled in databases were secured.\n\nAt the time of its adoption, the Commission reasoned that differences in the standard of\n\u201coriginality\u201d required for a database to enjoy copyright protection impeded the free movement\nof \u201cdatabase products\u201d across the Community. In particular, the Commission argued that the\ndifference between the lower \u201csweat of the brow\u201d copyright standard (i.e. involving\nconsiderable skill, labour or judgment in gathering together and/or checking a compilation)\nthat applied in common law Member States and the higher \u201cintellectual creation\u201d standard\nthat applied in droit d\u2019auteur Member States created distortion of trade in \u201cdatabase\nproducts\u201d.\n\nIn essence, the Directive sought to create a legal framework that would establish the ground\nrules for the protection of a wide variety of databases in the information age. It did so by\ngiving a high level of copyright protection to certain databases (\u201coriginal\u201d databases) and a\nnew form of \u201csui generis\u201d protection to those databases which were not \u201coriginal\u201d in the sense\nof the author's own intellectual creation (\u201cnon-original\u201d databases).\nThe approach chosen in the Directive was to harmonise the threshold of \u201coriginality\u201d. Those\n\u201cnon-original\u201d databases that did not meet the threshold would be protected by a newly\ncreated right.\n\u2013 In a first step, this was done by adopting the higher standard that applied in droit d\u2019auteur\ncountries, which had the effect of protecting fewer databases by copyright (which was now\nlimited to so-called \u201coriginal\u201d databases);\n\u2013 In a second step, for those databases that would previously have enjoyed protection under\nthe \u201csweat of the brow\u201d copyright, but no longer according to the harmonised \u201coriginality\u201d\nstandard, a new right was created \u2013 the \u201csui generis\u201d right to prevent extraction and reutilisation of the whole or a substantial part of the contents of a database in which there\nhas been substantial investment (\u201cnon-original\u201d databases).\n\nWhile \u201coriginal\u201d databases require an element of \u201cintellectual creation\u201d, \u201cnon-original\u201d\ndatabases are protected as long as there has been \u201cqualitatively or quantitatively a substantial\ninvestment in either the obtaining, verification or presentation of the contents\u201d of a database.\nThe \u201csui generis\u201d right is a Community creation with no precedent in any international\nconvention.

Amend section 55 (3) to:\n*  permit the making of multiple digital copies of all items in a CHI\u2019s collection, apart from those items regarding which the copyright owner has clearly stated in writing that the item is not to be digitised.\n* require CHIs to remove any item from their website upon request from its copyright owner. No damages should be payable to a copyright owner in any such case apart from where the CHI unreasonably refuses to take down an item.\n* require CHIs to consult with M\u0101ori before digitising and providing online public accessibility to cultural heritage originating from M\u0101ori. An assessment of the balance between the public interest in culture versus the owners\u2019 rights in their property should also be required.\n\n3. Section 55(3) (a)-(d) should be repealed.

In line with overseas practice, New Zealand\u2019s CHIs make use of digital technologies to achieve their objectives. However, many items in CHIs\u2019 collections are protected by copyright.

Conversely, the archiving exceptions have been drafted with a view that the main purpose of digitisation is similar to that of analogue reproduction; that is, to preserve a copy of an item in a collection that is in danger of deterioration. \n\nAnother reason for the inadequacy of the archiving exceptions is that, as for all permitted exceptions in national copyright laws, these provisions are required to comply with each of the \u201cthree step test\u201d provisions in Article 13 of the Agreement of Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (\u201cthe TRIPS Agreement\u201d).

Thus, of the 188 countries, 32 have no library exception in their domestic copyright statutes. These basic statistics suggest strongly that exceptions for libraries and archives are fundamental to the structure of copyright law throughout the world, and that the exceptions play an important role in facilitating library services and serving the social objectives of copyright law. The most common subject matter of the statutes is making copies (usually single copies) of works for readers, researchers, and other library users, and making copies for preservation of materials in the collections. Almost as frequently, countries have enacted statutes authorizing libraries to make copies for replacement of works that have suffered damage or loss.\n\nThese three topics long have been a mainstay of library exceptions, but recent years have brought revisions that reflect changing needs and new technologies. Most significantly, the European Union adopted a 2001 directive that authorized member countries to make digitized copies of works available to users on the premises of the library for research and study. That provision has been adopted in many of the European countries, and analogous statutes have been made a part of domestic law in countries beyond the E.U. On the other hand, relatively few countries have enacted truly distinctive law that breaks from various trends in lawmaking to address newly emerging problem areas at the border between copyright and digital technologies. Among the countries that have enacted extensive and original statutes in recent years are Canada, the Russian Federation, and the United Kingdom.\n\nWhile few countries have enacted comparable major changes, at any given time many countries are either revising their library exceptions or adopting entirely new copyright acts.

This suggests that subjects who have previously pirated digital material have a higher intention to pirate in the future, especially as the frequency of pirating increases. 76.5% of the subjects in this study have previously pirated. \n\n*The differences between males and females subjects with respect to past piracy behavior is noted. Of those who have not pirated digital material, 36.4% were men and 63.6% were women. Of those who have pirated digital material in the past, 65.1% were men and 34.9% were women. \n\n*Moral obligation also had a large effect on the intention to pirate digital material. Subjects who felt more guilt or moral obligation toward digital piracy have a lower intention to pirate. 50.7% of the subjects felt more guilt or moral obligation that pirating was not right, while 23.6% felt pirating was alright and acceptable behavior. \n\n*When comparing men and women, both groups felt that pirating was not right (54% and 46.5%, respectively).\n\n*Perceived behavioral control (PBC) also had an effect on the intention to pirate. Subjects who have the skills and resources to pirate digital media have a higher intention of pirate digital media. 84.3% of the subjects reported that it was easy or very easy to pirate digital media, and only 0.3% found it hard or very hard to pirate. In response to this high PBC, it is also interesting to note that the music and movie industries have been making pirating much more difficult to accomplish.\n\n*Attitude was not the best predictor of intention in terms of explained variance (as was the case in previous studies). This could be a result of the high correlation between attitude and moral obligation (r = 0.6481). \n\n*43.9% of the subjects indicated a more favorable attitude toward digital piracy, while 23.6% had a less favorable attitude and 32.5% neutral. \n\n*It is also noted that subjective norms was not significant in the extended TPB piracy intention model.", "comparative": 0, "intervention_response": "Potential policy implications: \n\n*Given that subjects believed that it was very easy to pirate digital material, as indicated by the PBC score, one method of prevention could be new technologies such as Digital Rights Management (DRM), which are already being implemented by many companies to control the distribution and use of their digital material (Sundararajan, 2004).\n\n*The subjects in this study also believed that they had the resources necessary to pirate digital material. CD burners are available at very reasonable prices and blank CDs are even cheaper than computer floppy disks. One option is to increase the cost/supply of these resources needed for piracy. By increasing the cost of piracy and decreasing the cost of the digital material, digital piracy can be combated effectively.\n\n*Since students have access to high-speed internet at their universities, a complete Hollywood movie can be downloaded in less than 30 minutes. Many universities are now employing high-end firewalls to prevent the illegal trading of digital media. The next step would be to target ISPs and software makers (that create these file-swapping programs) to curb digital piracy.\n\n*Many subjects didn\u2019t feel a great deal of guilt about pirating digital media; that it was acceptable behavior. There was a low level of guilt (moral obligation) towards digital piracy. To combat this, society has to be informed of how harmful piracy is. One method is the use of targeted ads like the ones targeting smoking in young teenagers. \n\n*Another method is the use of advertisements in movie theatres explaining how piracy affects the motion picture industry as well as individuals that are a part of the industry. Different harmful aspects of piracy should be presented to consumers in the public opinion court. Examples of appropriate behavior must be emphasized. \n\n*Another way would be to enforce newer ethical codes of conduct for information systems professional that stress different types of piracy (not just software) and its effect on business and society as a whole.", "url": "http://www.copyrightevidence.org/evidence-wiki/index.php/Cronan_and_Al-Rafee_(2008)", "type": "Study", "government_or_policy": 0, "abstract": "This study focuses on one of the newer forms of software piracy, known as digital piracy, and uses the Theory of Planned Behavior (TPB) as a framework to attempt to determine factors that influence digital piracy (the illegal copying/downloading of copyrighted software and media files).

This study observes weekly iTunes sales units for France, the UK, Italy, Spain, Germany, and Belgium.

Thus, while we do not know the actual volume of searches, we know when awareness of HADOPI peaked as measured by Google searches, and the relative height of that peak.

Assuming an average of \u20ac8.5 per album, this equates to an increase of \u20ac4.9 million ($6.7 million) in annual iTunes album sales due to HADOPI.\n\n* Together, our estimates suggest that HADOPI increased annual iTunes revenues (tracks plus albums) by about \u20ac9.6 million ($13 million) per year for the four majors combined.\n\n* Under the assumption that the four majors make up 70% of the industry, if sales for the remaining 30% of artists experienced the same change in sales as we observe for the major labels, then the impact of HADOPI was to increase overall digital iTunes sales by \u20ac13.8 million ($18.6 million) per year for the entire music industry.\n\n* The effect of HADOPI was larger for more heavily pirated genres like Rap and smaller for less pirated genres like Christian music or Jazz, which is what one would expect if the increase in sales were causally related to HADOPI.\n\n* Increased consumer awareness of HADOPI caused iTunes song and album sales to increase by 22.5% and 25% respectively relative to changes in the control group.\n\n* The study occurs before anyone received a third notice (i.e. before any cases have been referred to the criminal court), and the increase in sales is observed even before the law\u2019s final passage.

To do this, we obtained a panel of iTunes sales data from the four major music labels (Universal\nMusic, Warner Music, EMI Music and Sony Music) across a broad set of countries. We then applied a difference-in-difference approach, using sales trends in a control group of European countries to simulate the counterfactual of what music sales in France would have been if HADOPI had not been passed. Our results suggest that increased consumer awareness of HADOPI caused iTunes song and album sales to increase by 22.5% and 25% respectively relative to changes in the control group. In terms of robustness, we find that these sales changes are similar for each of the four major music labels, suggesting that our results are not peculiar to any particular label. We also find that the observed sales increase is much larger in genres that, prior to HADOPI, experienced high piracy levels (e.g., Rap and Hip Hop) than for less pirated genres (e.g., Christian music, classical, and jazz).

Hence, unlike file-sharing, streaming turns out to have no impact on physical recorded music sales but like file-sharing, streaming is complementary with attending concerts by national or international stars. The recursive model enables the authors to bring to light the indirect effect of explanatory variables on the attendance of concerts by international and national stars. For instance, the taste for music and the recommendation of friends exhibit both direct and indirect effects on concert attendance. Being young, an intensive Internet user and using the web to get information and advice on music all favour the practice of streaming and indirectly play a role in concert attendance. Conversely, being male and earning a large income only affect the INTER variable.\n\n* Results concerning socio-economic variables are as expected. Individuals between 40 and 59 years-old buy more CDs. Age is also a strong determinant of attendance of classical concerts. Income and education are positively correlated with music consumption. Internet users in large cities have a higher probability of going to concerts of classical music or by local artists, which can be explained by the availability of these concerts in bigger cities. More surprising is the negative relationship between the local population size and the consumption of CDs in conventional offline retailers. One explanation might be that since access to live music is more difficult in less densely populated areas, the best way to obtain access to music content is to buy physical goods. It is also noted that the variable controlling for regional specificity also seems to capture a singularity for respondents from Brittany.\n\n* The results support two major findings concerning the impact of streaming on music consumption.

By documenting changes in discourse occurring between 1998 and 2004 over the labeling of music file-sharing as deviant, it seeks to unveil how power machinates in establishing the parameters between acceptable and unacceptable behaviors. In doing so, Foucault's work on power is used as a starting point for investigating strategies employed by corporate elites and file-sharers in order to shift the balance of power. The contest between discourses seeking to restrict or enhance the capacities of free agents in online environments is evidenced in the mutability of a legal discourse seeking to normalize online life. Until now, how the online \u201cmusic pirates\u201d should be disciplined is in a state of flux where certain developments appear to be favoring corporate interests and others, the interests of music file-sharers. In this struggle, online discourses seeking to curtail freedoms and opportunities advanced by corporate elites and online discourses of freedom purported by music file-sharers, are reversible. This reversibility suggests that online, some offline discourses would be a hindrance and as such, their agents could resist the dominant online discourse by engaging in creative behaviors. Likewise, traversing offline producer-led discourses with innovative and creative actions online could lead to consumers' autonomy. This paper concludes that the significance of these online struggles is embedded not only in their outcomes but also in the processes leading to them.

In a series of high profile decisions, content industries persuaded courts to accept expansive interpretations of contributory enforcement, to create novel doctrines of copyright infringement, and to apply broad interpretations of statutory damage provisions. Many private file-sharers, technology companies, university administrators and Internet service providers have felt the reach of this litigation effort. Yet a significant empirical anomaly exists: even as the copyright industry has ramped up the level of deterrence, online copyright infringements continue unabated.\n\nWhy has the legal battle against file-sharers been so ineffective? The most straightforward explanation is that infringers are not deterred, either because the probability of getting caught remains remote or because the sanctions are not sufficiently salient. If that is the case, the expansive statutory damage award remedies in recent decisions such as Capitol Records v. Thomas-Rasset and Sony BMG v. Tenebaum, carry renewed promise for the entertainment industry. \n\nIn this Article we claim that this deterrence-based approach will prove futile and even counterproductive to the goals of copyright holders. We argue that copyright law faces conditions similar to Prohibition and other historical episodes of enforcement failure. When infringements are widespread, effective deterrence cannot be attained without raising enforcement to levels that undermine the support for the underlying rules. As a result, enforcement has the inadvertent effect of moving behavior in the opposite direction from that intended by the law. In the context of copyright law, enforcement has increased the gap between the social and legal perceptions of copyright law. Because file sharers, as a group, perceive copyright litigation as excessive, this inadvertently strengthens opposition to the legally protected interests of copyright law. \n\nTo further our understanding of the interplay between enforcement and public attitudes, we conduct two empirical studies on norms and copyright law. The results confirm that copyright enforcement is a double-edged sword. While stringent sanctions have a modest deterrent effect on file-sharing behavior, they increase anti-copyright sentiments among frequent offenders. This raises a spectacular challenge for copyright enforcement-the more copyright owners push to step up sanctions for copyright infringements; the more the public resents the protected rights. Consequently, stepping up sanctions tends to increase - rather than decrease - the rate and frequency of infringing activities. Our key results suggest therefore, that more stringent copyright enforcement will further erode respect for copyrights and may prove counterproductive to copyright owners.", "entities":

shift in the\nenforcement of copyright law. While copyright enforcement\nagainst private copying traditionally centered on commercial intermediaries\nand piracy, content owners now also pursue infringement\nactions against consumers and private copiers\ndirectly. While consumers of pirated content have traditionally\nbeen captured indirectly through taxes or blanket licenses, they\nare now subjected to a mass litigation campaign.\nDespite the wide media attention and spectacular headlines,\nlitigation has produced only limited results in the present era of\ndigital downloading and peer-to-peer (or \\\"P2P\\\") file swapping.\nLawsuits against private copiers have not halted file-sharing activities.\nAn ever-increasing number of unlicensed downloads are\ntaking place in private homes all over the world. According to\nrecent data, over twelve million people' are simultaneously sharing\n1.08 billion music, movie, and software files on the Internet at\nany given moment.\nWhy are individuals unresponsive to the increased costs ofdownloading unlicensed music? One possible reason is that individuals\nsimply believe that the chances of being caught are too\nremote because there are so many people downloading at any\ngiven moment in time. Downloading fell temporarily during the\ninitial wave of lawsuits but increased again during subsequent\nrounds of lawsuits as file swappers updated their estimation of\nthe chances of getting caught.3\nNotwithstanding the limited deterrent effect of lawsuits on file\nsharing, record industry representatives, who often refer to lawsuits\nin terms of \\\"educating\\\" the public on copyright law,4 have\nannounced that they will continue to pursue litigation against individual\nfile swappers. In this Article, we suggest that if litigation\nindeed serves purposes other than deterrence, legal sanctions are\nunlikely to alter the social meaning and legitimacy of peer-topeer\nnetworks and file sharing. Because of a convinced belief\namong copyright users that file sharing should be legal, copyright\nenforcement is challenged by a social norm complication. Drawing\non socio-psychological literature and new data from an empirical\nstudy, we posit that copyright litigation faces an\nimpossibility theorem: lawsuits against file sharers cannot simultaneously\nachieve effective deterrence and promote procopyright\nnorms.\nPart I provides an overview of recent copyright litigation\nagainst copyright infringers on file-sharing networks. In Part 2, we apply the rational choice paradigm to litigation of private\ncopying and complement it with norm-based approaches.\nPart III examines behavioral adjustments and social norms effects\nin a scenario study where students are subjected to varying\nmodalities of copyright law enforcement. The aim of the study is\nto investigate the effect of copyright law enforcement on anticopyright\nnorms among file swappers on peer-to-peer networks\nand to examine differences between experienced users of filesharing\ntechnologies and individuals who have not (yet) engaged\nin file sharing.\nThe evidence from our study raises the hypothesis that deterrence\nand norms work at cross-purposes. Experienced users of\npeer-to-peer technology have internalized an anticopyright norm\nthat cannot be unraveled through enforcement. Anticopyright\nnorms of file swapppers are strengthened when the level of copyright\nenforcement increases, which results in more downloading\nwhenever enforcement is temporarily suspended. Enforcement has an ambivalent effect on individuals who have no experience\nwith file sharing. Severe sanctions do not have a counterproductive\neffect on copyright norms of such \\\"non-file sharers,\\\" yet exposure\nto information on copyright enforcement against peer-topeer\nsoftware reinforces the belief or expectation that others are\ndownloading.\nPart IV reflects on the lessons learned from the study, in particular\nwith regard to the policy choices that regulators, courts,\nand copyright-dependent industries face when approaching the\nwidespread use of copyrighted material on file-sharing networks.\nThese options, including criminal prosecutions of digital piracy,\ncopyright education, self-help strategies, and collective licensing,\nare evaluated in light of the interaction of deterrence and anticopyright\nnorms. We will argue that social norm backlash is\nparticularly relevant for copyright law because circumvention\ntechnology and the so-called technological \\\"arms race\\\" between\ncontent holders and pirates inevitably create lapses in copyright\nenforcement. During these intervals of reduced enforcement,\nconduct is determined by norms.\nFinally, Part V considers the recent decision by the Supreme\nCourt in MGM Studios, Inc. v. Grokster, Ltd., which held that\nproducers of file-sharing applications can potentially be held ac-countable for distributing software. Because Grokster focuses\non the commercial intent of P2P producers, it is doubtful that the\ndecision will be an effective tool in reducing the availability of\nfile-sharing technology. As digital technology becomes more decentralized,\nit is increasingly judgment-proof. File-sharing applications\nare produced in user-driven innovation environments\nthat operate without centralized, residual claimants. Life cycles\nof software applications extend beyond the legal and financial\nstatus of their creators. This suggests that we have only seen the\ntip of the iceberg with regard to lawsuits against private copiers.\nWe use copyright enforcement as a case study for the interaction\nbetween law enforcement and norms in general. The literature\non social norms suggests that when legal sanctions violate\nthe subjective conception of behavior that is being punished, individuals\nrespond differently when that enforcement coincides\nwith preexisting notions of what is just or appropriate. Although\nsome studies have investigated the conflict of deterrence and\nnorms with regard to tax evasion, the dynamics of social norms\nand law enforcement remain poorly understood. This Article addresses\nseveral gaps in the existing literature. While there is an\nabundance of theoretical attention to social norms, there is little\nempirical data on the interaction between norms and law enforcement.\nAlso, this Article supplements the limited literature\non enforcement patterns in copyright law.", "entities": ["Dynamical_system", "File_sharing", "Iceberg", "The_Evidence_(TV_series)", "Theorem", "Peremptory_norm", "Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer", "Arms_race", "Copyright_infringement", "Private_copying_levy", "Opposition_to_copyright", "Internet", "Tax_evasion", "Norm_(social)", "Peer-to-peer", "Rational_choice_theory", "Grokster", "Self-help"], "country": null, "authentic_link": null, "citation_count": null, "literature_review": 0, "industries": null, "disciplines": ["Law"], "year": 2005.0, "label": "Norms and Enforcement: The Case against Copyright Litigation", "policies": ["Enforcement"], "link": null}, {"collection_methods": ["Quantitative Collection Methods", "Quantitative data/text mining", "Qualitative Collection Methods", "Qualitative content/text mining"], "data_description": "This article uses data from 42 US Cases", "analysis_methods": ["Quantitative Analysis Methods", "Quantitative content analysis (e.g. text or data mining)", "Qualitative Analysis Methods", "Textual Content Analysis", "Legal Analysis"], "authors": "Depoorter and Walker (2013)", "issues": ["Relationship between protection", "Harmony of interest assumption between authors and publishers", "Effects of protection on industry structure"], "entity_count": null, "wordcount": {"effects": 1, "causes": 1, "in_order": 1, "piracy": 1, "include": 2, "public_domain": 1, "actions": 1, "copyright": 2, "occurs": 1, "legal": 1, "rise": 1, "harm": 1, "substantive": 1, "combat": 1, "social": 2, "litigation": 2, "enforcement": 2, "public": 1, "targeted": 1, "help": 1, "Copyright": 1, "false_positives": 5, "positive": 1, "rights": 1, "damage": 2, "registration": 1, "due_to": 1, "seeking": 1, "give": 1, "behavior": 1, "would": 1, "analyzes": 1, "as_well": 1, "licensing": 1, "transaction_costs": 1, "significant": 1, "this_Article": 1, "review": 1, "requirements": 1, "increased": 2, "form": 1, "actual": 1, "speech": 1, "uses": 1, "statutory": 1, "problem": 1, "Copyright_Act": 1, "copyright_law": 1, "free": 1, "provisions": 1, "copyright_registrations": 1, "offers": 1, "markets": 1, "copyright_claims": 1, "to_encourage": 1, "taken": 1, "infringements": 1}, "plain_text_proposition": "Copyright false positives result in social harms that are often difficult to detect, but are nonetheless widespread and pernicious in their effects.

The Motion Picture Association of America estimates that US studios lose more than $3 billion annually in box office revenue from piracy. They have launched a major effort to prevent these losses. Yet their efforts are hampered by the ex post, counterfactual, and indirect methods by which losses are usually estimated. This paper addresses these issues directly. We develop and estimate a statistical model of the effects of piracy on the box-office performance of a widely-released movie. The model discredits the argument that piracy increases sales, showing unambiguously that Internet piracy diminished the box-office revenues of a widely released motion picture. The model overcomes a major weakness of counterfactual or \u201cbut for piracy\u201d methods widely used to estimate damages. These counterfactual methods violate the \u201cnobody knows\u201d principle because they forecast what the movie would have earned in the absence piracy. The model we present does not violate this basic principle of motion picture uncertainty. We estimate that pre-release and contemporaneous Internet downloads of a major studio movie accelerated its box-office revenue decline and caused the picture to lose about $40 million in revenue.", "entities": ["Counterfactual_conditional", "FastTrack", "World_Wide_Web", "Ship_commissioning", "DVD", "File_Transfer_Protocol", "BitTorrent", "Gnutella", "Copyright_infringement", "Internet_Relay_Chat", "Usenet", "Statistical_model", "Internet", "EDonkey_network", "Advertising_agency", "The_Source_(magazine)", "Film"], "country": ["United States of America"], "authentic_link": "http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11151-007-9141-0", "citation_count": 1.0, "literature_review": 0, "industries": ["Film and motion pictures", "Television programmes", "Creative, arts and entertainment"], "disciplines": ["General", "Entertainment \u2022 Media", "Economics of the Arts and Literature"], "year": 2007.0, "label": "Estimating the Effects of Movie Piracy on Box-office Revenue", "policies": ["Enforcement"], "link": null}, {"collection_methods": ["Quantitative Collection Methods", "Survey Research (quantitative; e.g. sales/income reporting)", "Historical Methods"], "data_description": "The article identifies, reviews and analyzes every application made to the Board pursuant to the Canadian legislation (s 77) and catalogues them into an organized database of files.

TDM is, according to some, a growing and very promising economic sector. Its applications seem to be full of potentialities, in a whole range of sectors, from forensic investigation, to predictive marketing and scientific research in all kinds of sectors (be they commercial or not). At the same time, in today\u2019s world, most information becomes available in a digital format, either from its first creation or because of the growing digitization of existing print archives.\nResearch is more and more relying on data analysis techniques and, as the quantity of information grows, so does the need to be able to rely on data analysis, because computers and software will more and more have to be called upon to analyze quantities of materials which human beings will, for time and resources reasons, no more have the possibility to read and screen. Data analysis also offers the possibility to uncover new relationships between information and data which science had always been unaware of.\nFrom a legal point of view, data analysis raises various issues, one of the important one being probably privacy and personal data protection.

However, the Study observed that the InfoSoc Directive does not regulate the relation between the making available right and the reproduction right. Both rights are autonomous and can apply cumulatively, so that a single technical act may simultaneously fall under the making available and the right of reproduction, even if those rights are managed separately.

Pressplay and MusicNet, both of which first offered their services in December 2001, each launched with approximately 100,000 tracks\u2014just a portion of the recordings contained in the catalogs of the then five major labels.

What once was a prolonged operation requiring not months but years of ongoing negotiations can now, at least in large part, be accomplished in as short a timeframe as under ninety days. \n\n*  At least in the past, certain service offerings that were not licensed by the quorum of major labels and publishers were voluntarily licensed by other sets of rights owners.", "comparative": 0, "intervention_response": "* Because the copyright statute so heavily influences industries like the music industry, evaluating the state of private licensing negotiations amounts to evaluating the state of the copyright statute. To consider the merits of copyright reform in one direction or another, policy makers should be gathering all the empirical evidence they can. This Article has aimed to contribute to deliberations over copyright reform by describing the nature of the licensing negotiations for digital music services. Secrecy and private information render it infeasible to construct a large, quantitative data set consisting of both successful and failed attempts at licensing. Studies like ours, however, based on interviews with individuals directly involved in licensing negotiations, shed important light on the realities of the marketplace. \n\n* The direct licensing process can require a surprisingly similar amount of time (at the median) to the time it takes a rate-setting proceeding to reach its resolution. In both cases there are the extremes\u2014when the rate-setting process drags for years, or the direct licensing process never succeeds. But we do need to understand whether and why these two very different paths to market\u2014each determining service features, royalty rates, and consumer pricing in different ways\u2014may actually require quite similar periods of time.\n\n* In future designs of the copyright statute, the goal should be efficient resolution of conflicts between copyright owners and firms with new distribution technologies. Congress must understand that unless they choose to make certain arrangements mandatory (i.e., unless Congress forbids contracting around the copyright statute in various ways) their statutory scheme is merely one constraint in a complex private negotiation.

In this Article we present the first qualitative and quantitative data about the licensing process for on-demand music streaming services, gleaned from confidential interviews with executives and attorneys. We report our findings about the time it takes to license a nascent service, if negotiations succeed; the number of record labels and publishers with which new music services typically deal; the general processes through which these licenses evolve; and how changes in the law over the period may have affected the dynamics of these negotiations.

The Internet provides an opportunity to make archival material more widely accessible; however, repositories\u2019 copyright practices in making their holdings available online may affect the extent to which wider access to archival material is actually achieved. The study employed four different sources of evidence, i.e., the website content of 154 Canadian repositories whose websites feature archival material from the repository\u2019s holdings; copyright\npolicy and procedure documents of those repositories; 106 responses to a questionnaire sent to the staff of those repositories; and 22 interviews with repository staff members. In terms of selection for online access, the study found that the repositories studied prefer to select items that are perceived to incur little risk of copyright infringement (because the copyright has expired or because the repository owns the copyright), or items that require few or no resources to investigate copyright status or obtain copyright authorizations. Thus, with regard to selection, repositories were more restrictive than the law required, largely due to lack of resources.\nAlthough repositories have no legal or professional obligation to enforce others\u2019 copyright interests, they nonetheless attempt to control further uses of their online holdings through the use of technical measures (e.g., low resolution images, watermarks, etc.) or non-technical measures (e.g., conditions placed on further uses), for reasons not necessarily related to copyright.

With regard to the first group of predictions, the experimental observations overwhelmingly supported the Nash as opposed to the Cooperative solution. However, while the Nash solution is much better supported in a dichotomous comparison between the two, the experimental results typically displayed some degree of slippage in the direction of cooperation. The convergence toward Nash was weaker under the fixed partners as opposed to the varying partners protocol, and also was weaker in the mature (sixteenth round) choices than the overall behavior.

Further research could certainly be carried out on that point.\n\no An exception or attenuation of the lex loci protectionis could be envisaged so as to\nmutually recognize the validity of a dedication to the public domain when valid in the\ncountry of origin of the work.\n\no The issue of orphan works should be dealt with at the international level or at least, a\nmutual recognition of the status of the orphan work applied in one country should be\nrecognized by other Parties to the Berne Convention (except when identification or location of the author can be solved in this other country). WIPO should also help to set up networks of information about works in order to facilitate the identification of authors of orphan works. This would clarify the protected or unprotected status of orphan works.\n\no International endeavours should be devoted to developing technical or informational\ntools to identify the contents of the public domain, particularly as far as the duration of\ncopyright is concerned. Such tools can be data collections on works, databases of public domain works, or public domain calculators. International cross-operation and cross-referencing of such tools is of particular importance.\n\no The 1996 WIPO Treaties could be modified to integrate, in the definition of \u201cRights\nManagement Information\u201d, any electronic information pertaining to public domain works.\n\n- As far as the availability and sustainability of the public domain is concerned:\no The availability of the public domain should be enhanced, notably through cooperation\nwith cultural heritage institutions and UNESCO (through its work on the preservation of\nintangible cultural heritage).\n\no Legal deposit should be encouraged at national level, which might involve some\nfinancial and logistical help for developing countries. At international level, catalogues\nand cross-referencing of deposited works should be set up.\n\no The role of cultural heritage institutions, and mainly libraries, in the labelling,\ncataloguing, preserving and making available of public domain works, should be\nrecognised and supported, particularly in the digital environment.\n\no Research should be carried out to identify means to promote the divulgation and\nexploitation of public domain material in terms of funding and incentives. The research\ncould include the tool of the domaine public payant, as means to make commercial\nusers of public domain works contribute, through a minimal sum, to the collecting and\nmaintaining of public domain material carried out by public institutions. Where the moral\nright is perpetual, there should be ways of controlling possible abuses in exercising the\ndivulgation or integrity right.\n\no Any extension of the scope or duration of copyright and related rights, both at\ninternational and national level, should take into account the empirical effects on the\nsustainability of the public domain.\n\n- As far as the non-exclusivity and non-rivalry of the public domain is concerned:\no Legal means should be found to prevent the recapture of exclusivity in works that have\nfallen into the public domain, whether through another intellectual property right\n(trademark or right in databases), property rights, other legal entitlements or technical\nprotection, if such exclusivity is similar in scope or effect to that of copyright or is\ndetrimental to non-rivalrous or concurrent uses of the public domain work.\n\no The 1996 WIPO Treaties should be amended to prohibit a technical impediment to\nreproduce, publicly communicate or making available a work that has fallen into the\npublic domain. There is no legal basis for the enforcement of technical protection\nmeasures applied to the public domain, as public domain status should guarantee the\nright to make re-use, modification, reproduction and communication.

The Information Society Directive 2001/29/EC states that in situations where prejudice to the rightholder is likely to be minimal, no obligation for payment may arise (Recital 35). Compensation for the use of orphan works should follow the same principle, especially those that have not been in economic use for decades.

An example would be the private diary of a life during wartime, written by a person whose son or daughter, having become the rightholder, gives it to a library after the death of the author, so that it can be consulted by researchers.

The copyright status of this was more difficult to discern but the majority is believed to be copyrighted and most likely shared illegitimately; 0.48% (just 48 files out of 10,000) could not be identified. Of all 10,000 files comprising the most popular content held on the PublicBT tracker, only one was identified as non-copyrighted (a file containing a list of IP addresses used to help users guard against spam and peer to peer monitoring). There is no evidence to support the idea that the transfer of non-copyrighted content such as Linux distributions makes up a significant amount of bittorrent traffic. Analysis strongly indicates that private bittorrent sites (which would not usually make use of PublicBT) are overwhelmingly used for the purposes of illegitimately sharing copyrighted data. \n\n*An examination of 2,000 random links pointing to content held on cyberlockers found that 91.5% of links pointing to non-pornographic material were linking to copyrighted material, or 73.15% of all links.   \n\n*A comparison of video streaming site usage estimated that 4.7% of video streaming data traffic is copyrighted content illegitimately streamed from video hosting sites.\n\n*Analysis of content posted to a number of Usenet newsgroups found that at least 93.4% of posts contained copyrighted material. \n\n* On the day of analysis, most upload and download activity was concentrated amongst a small number of those 2.7m torrents with 34.9% of all peers involved in the top 10,000 (just 0.37% of all torrents). There was an enormous long-tail of content which had only a few or no seeds or a few or no leechers. The chart shows the breakdown of all 2.72m swarms according to the number of downloaders (commonly called leechers) attached to each swarm12. Clearly, most of the swarms had only a small number of active downloaders or no active downloaders at all. 0.2% of torrents (6,468) had 100 or more downloaders; 2.6% of torrents (71,405) had from ten to 99 downloaders; 51.9% of torrents (1,413,606) had from one to nine downloaders; 45.2% of torrents (1,229,961) had no active downloads. A similar spread was evident for seeders (users holding a complete copy of the file). For almost half of all torrents (1.32m or 48.5%), no seed was connected.On the other hand, a very small overall proportion of content attracted large numbers of downloaders, representing a large proportion of all connected users.

On average over this period, 56.5 million Europeans were employed by\nIPR-intensive industries, out of a total employment of approximately 218 million. In addition, another 20 million jobs were generated in industries that supply goods and services to the IPR-intensive industries. Taking indirect jobs into account, the total number of IPR\u2011dependent jobs rises to just under 77 million (35.1%).\nOver the same period, IPR-intensive industries generated almost 39% of total economic activity\n(GDP) in the EU, worth \u20ac 4.7 trillion.

It has never been so important to foster the \u201cvirtuous circle\u201d leading from Research and Development (R&D) investment to jobs \u2013 via innovation, competitive advantage and economic success \u2013 as in today\u2019s world of increasingly globalised markets and the knowledge\neconomy. This process depends on several different factors, but an efficient system of intellectual property rights (IPR) undoubtedly ranks among the most important, given IP\u2019s capacity to encourage creativity and innovation, in all its various forms, throughout the economy.\nEurope already has a long tradition in this area: European countries have played a major part in\nshaping a modern and balanced system of IP rights which not only guarantees innovators their due\nreward but also stimulates a competitive market. It is nevertheless vital to ensure that the system remains a useful instrument in implementing new innovation policies designed to achieve those goals. At the same time, there have been several calls from industry for indicators to measure the economic impact of IP rights. Moreover, in view of the question marks which, in public debate, have sometimes been raised over IP\u2019s role in supporting innovation and creativity, it is essential that facts and figures be produced to ensure such debate is based on sound evidence.\nThat is why the Office for Harmonization in the Internal Market (OHIM), acting through the European Observatory on Infringements of Intellectual Property Rights, and the European Patent Office (EPO) decided to join forces and carry out this study in co-operation with the European Commission, in particular DG Internal Market and Services and Eurostat.\nThere have already been several studies on specific IP rights, industrial sectors or countries, but the OHIM-EPO study is the first to quantify the overall contribution made by IPR\u2011intensive industries to the EU economy, in terms of output, employment, wages and trade, taking into account the major\nIP rights (patents, trade marks, designs, copyrights, geographical indications).

This was a significant challenge to commercialisation.\n\n*Archives, museums, and libraries were frequently cited as useful partners when seeking access to public domain works, able to provide access to source material and data needed to ascertain copyright status of work.\n\n*There was little concern about competition due to non-excludability of source material, but firms worried about costs of marketing and sustaining PD projects when initial development cost and investment was also low.\n\n*Clarity on legal use (e.g. requirements for \u2018diligent search\u2019 when using orphan  works) would improve commercialisation potential.\n\nThe main findings for Study 2 were as follows:\n\n*Use of both public domain and third party licensed material were significantly associated with higher likelihood of project success.\n\n*Influence of public domain status on success rate was most pronounced in the mediums of Comics and Theatre, compared with Publishing and Video Games. This suggests that the role of PD materials differs across mediums.

Biographies for notable authors born prior to 1880 have a greater likelihood of containing an image than those born more recently, even though camera  technology became widespread in the 20th Century. Less than 58% of authors in the sample born after 1880 have images associated with their Wikipedia pages.  \n\n*Controlling for notoriety of authors, composers and lyricists using a  matched-pairs technique, we found that pages with public domain images attracted between 17% and  19% more visitors than pages where no image was available, reflecting the value those images contribute to the Wikipedia resource.\n\n*Using commercially equivalent licence fees obtained from Corbis and Getty for images relating to the biographical sample, we estimate a total value of USD $208 million (GBP \u00a3138million) per year for the 1,983,609 English-language Wikipedia pages in appropriate categories which contain public domain images.", "comparative": 1, "intervention_response": "The authors make three policy recommendations: \n\n*Assist communities in valorising the public domain; members of the public participate as both consumers and stakeholders in relation to the public domain. As much as possible, members of the public and stakeholder communities should be offered the opportunity to be involved in curating, preserving and disseminating public  domain materials. Ideally, outputs should be of professional quality and should be presented in formats which are machine-readable, manipulable, and adaptable to different mediums (to facilitate downstream use).\n\n*As far as possible, clarify legal status of public domain; Government should provide guidance on those issues, in a format that is accessible to creators and businesses.  Educational initiatives should be aimed at helping UK firms understand what is likely  to  be  still  in copyright and what is likely to be in the public domain.  Increasing the strategic capabilities of the UK media sector with respect to intellectual property will likely increase licensing of copyright works alongside uptake of public domain materials \u2013 both types of usage require similar legal awareness and capacity.  \n\n*Improve access to information; many respondents focused their concern on transaction costs, as searching for and using public domain materials was often more costly than licensing a less-suitable copyright work or hiring-in a replacement original work,  disinhibiting creation. Information about availability and access to public domain  works will help entrepreneurs make strategic decisions. Centralised databases of works with associated metadata, such as the Wikimedia Commons project, have sought to overcome such problems in limited, specific contexts.

A key recommendation made by Hargreaves is that the Government create a new fair dealing copyright exception for parody. However, a shortage of empirical data renders policy intervention in this area difficult. The issue is complicated by the inherently creative nature of parody, ambiguity about its definition and the multiplicity of \neconomic and legal approaches that may be applied. \n\nIn December 2011, following a call to tender procedure, the UK Intellectual Property Office (IPO) commissioned the Centre for Intellectual Property Policy and Management (CIPPM) at Bournemouth University to undertake research into the potential effects for rightsholders, creators and audiences of introducing a copyright exception for Parody in the UK. This synopsis reports the key findings from two complementary studies carried out by the researchers. Study I presents new empirical data about the rate and nature of parody content production on the online video platform YouTube, and its impact on commercial exploitation of original works where they can be considered to be part of the same market.  Study II distils regulatory options for a parody exception from a comparative review of seven jurisdictions. \n\nThe current synopsis document contains three parts. First, it discusses the empirical findings from Study I. A sample of 8,299 user-generated music video parodies was constructed relating to the top-100 charting music singles in the UK for the year 2011. Secondly, this synopsis presents a distilled discussion of the legal treatment of parodies in seven  jurisdictions  that  have  implemented  or  are  considering  implementing  a  copyright exception for parody (Australia, Canada, France, Germany, Netherlands, UK, and USA). The underlying  principles  (including  economic  and  constitutional)  governing  divergent  legal approaches are identified, and a list of policy options is presented. Thirdly, this synopsis document provides a synthesis of the legal analysis and the empirical data. Each of the policy options identified in Study II is examined for its likely impact on the empirical sample gathered in Study I.

Nevertheless, there are clearly pressures on European art markets, in all price ranges, and for both the auction and dealer sectors, and it is recalled that the scope of the application of the resale right will be significantly expanded following the ending of the derogation for the works of deceased artists on 1 January 2012.\nAt the same time, the quality of the administration of the resale right appears to vary considerably across the EU, bringing costs to art market professionals and artists alike. The burden can be particularly high for those at the lower end of the market who are proportionately more deeply affected by the costs of administering the right.

To this end it intends to establish a Stakeholder Dialogue, tasked with making recommendations for the improvement of the system of resale right collection and distribution in the EU.\n\u2022 More broadly, the European Commission is concerned that collecting societies should operate to a high standard of governance and transparency with regard to their members and to commercial users, and will bring forward a proposal in this regard during 2012 to apply in equal measure to collecting societies administering the resale right.", "url": "http://www.copyrightevidence.org/evidence-wiki/index.php/European_Commission_(2011)", "type": "Study", "government_or_policy": 1, "abstract": "The Resale Right Directive (2001/84/EC of 27 September 2001) ('the Directive') was conceived with two major objectives in mind: to \\\"ensure that authors of graphic and plastic works of art share in the economic success of their original works of art\\\"1 on the one hand and, on the other, to harmonise the application of the right across the EU. It was considered that \\\"The application or non-application of such a right has a significant impact on the competitive environment within the internal market, since the existence or absence of an obligation to pay on the basis of the resale right is an element which must be taken into account by each individual wishing to sell a work of art. This right is therefore a factor which contributes to the creation of distortions of competition as well as displacement of sales within the Community.\\\"\n\nConsistent with these aims, the Directive promoted harmonisation of the substantive conditions for the application of the resale right: (i) eligibility and the duration of protection; (ii) the categories of works of art to which the resale right applies; (iii) the scope of the acts to\nbe covered i.e. all acts involving dealers in works of art; (iv) the royalty rates applicable across defined price bands; (v) the maximum threshold for a minimum resale price attracting\nthe right (\u20ac3,000); and (vi) provisions on third country nationals entitled to receive royalties. The Directive came into force on 1 January 2006.\n\nAt the time the Directive was agreed 4 of the then 15 Member States did not apply the resale right in national law: Austria, Ireland, the Netherlands and the UK. These Member States enjoyed a transitional period to 1 January 2010 during which they could choose not to apply the resale right to the works of eligible deceased artists. These Member States, together with Malta, made use of this provision, and of the option to extend the derogation period for a further 2 years. This derogation comes to an end on 1 January 2012, at which point the Directive must be fully implemented in all Member States.\n\nArticle 11 of the Directive foresees that the Commission should submit to the European Parliament, the Council and the Economic and Social Committee a report on the implementation and the effect of the Directive.

The absence of a secure licensing framework is, however, a slight disadvantage with this option as far as legal certainty is concerned.\nThe option based on mutual recognition, on the other hand, could result in slightly higher operating costs for libraries, depending on whether Member States choose costly licensing systems to authorise the lawful display of orphan works. Nevertheless, the additional license substitutes for the requisite \\\"permission to use\\\" and would thus provide additional safeguards against subsequent infringement claims. Also, as long as a diligent search has been conducted, Member States can reduce operating costs by adopting rules that orphan works can be integrated into existing licensing schemes covering digital libraries.\nProperty rights are affected in the same manner by both options. Notwithstanding a prior diligent search, the orphan work is being used without the right holders' express authorisation.\nHowever, since the mutual recognition option grants Member States the possibility to establish suitable instruments to substitute for an express authorisation, The mutual recognition option is better suited to allow Member States to provide a higher level of protection for property rights.", "comparative": 0, "intervention_response": "The chosen approach is therefore based on the mutual recognition of the orphan work status\ndetermined after a diligent search in the Member State where the work was first published.

These benefits have recently been recognised by the G8 leaders and enshrined in an Open Data Charter.\n\nYet, studies conducted on behalf of the European Commission show that industry and citizens still face difficul ties in finding and re-using it. In response, in December 2011 the Commission adopted a package of measures (2) to overcome barriers to re-use and reduce the fragmentation of data markets. The key element was the recently adopted Directive 2013/37/EU amending Directive 2003/98/EC on the re-use of public sector information.\n\nThe amended Directive calls on the Commission to help the Member States implement the new rules by issuing guidelines on recommended standard licences, datasets and charging for the re-use of documents.

Member States also are required to award the rightholder the reasonable costs of investigating, taking legal action against, and rectifying the infringement.\nAs the IPRED has been implemented in national legislation and carried out in practice, however, the rightholder often cannot recover in full the compensation appropriate to an infringement, or the full costs that the rightholder has borne to redress the infringement. Some do not award compensation for all relevant types of damage. Many limit the types and amount of costs that can be recovered. Some courts are unwilling to award damages with respect to infringements and damage that clearly have taken place but are difficult to quantify precisely.\nThese legal and practical drawbacks mean that some of the profit or other economic benefit of an infringement often remains with the infringer even after the rightholder has brought a \u201csuccessful\u201d civil case, or that some of the cost of litigation or other cost of redressing that infringement is borne by the rightholder rather than by the infringer. As a result, damages and costs awards can effectively leave the rightholder in a worse position, and the infringer in a better position, than either would have been in had the infringement and the civil litigation not occurred.

Only 13% of Poles have purchased a book, a movie, or a musical recording in the year before the survey. Informal circulation is the second source of cultural content with the broadcast mass media like radio and TV being the first. The informal sphere covers 39% of Poles \u2013 thus being three times as large as the market-bound circulation of cultural content. \n\n*Engaging with the informal circulations of digital content strongly correlates with age. We should assume that populations ages 40 and older do not participate in smaller circulation of digital content.\n\n*The survey did not corroborate the thesis about informal circulations supplanting the formal ones. The people who most actively engage in the informal content circulations (i.e. Internet users who download files) constitute the largest segment of the purchasers. They comprise 32% of all people purchasing books, 31% of all people purchasing movies, and over half of all people who buy music. The 15 to 24 age group made up the biggest part of the group of people that both purchase content and download it from the Internet \u2013 despite common assumptions that younger generations lack funds to purchase content. \n\n*A quarter of all Poles engage with the informal circulation without purchasing any content from the formal circulations. Membership in this group is strongly linked  with age \u2013 the percentage of such people is much higher in the younger age groups,  while significantly dropping off in age groups over 50. \n\n*62% of Poles do not participate in either the formal or the informal circulations of cultural content. The primary form of cultural activity for most Poles is probably watching television and listening to the radio. \n\n*The average Internet user buys three times more books and movies and seven times more music in comparison with people who don\u2019t use the Internet. Internet usage is the primary distinguishing factor when it comes to interest in cultural content, which is furthercorrelated with age and education. More importantly, these differences are even more pronounced where accessing content doesn\u2019t require any financial commitment, such as borrowing books, movies, or music. \n\n*Active Internet users are a group especially inclined to participate in circulations of culture. Strong differences are revealed when Internet users are split into less active and more active ones: 88% of active Internet users participate in the informal circulation of music, 73% participate in informal book circulation, and 78% engage in informal movie circulation (in the three months preceding the survey). 72% of active internet users claim to have downloaded files from the Internet \u2013 e.g. from file-sharing networks or from file hosting services. \n\n*92% of active users claim to have engaged in informal circulations if their definition is expanded to include all avenues of content access (such as streaming, sharing files with friends, etc.). If we include the informal circulation of content stored on physical media (e.g. sharing and copying books or CDs and DVDs) in the aforementioned definition, then practically all of the respondents (95%) claim to have engaged in such content circulations. \n\n*75% of active internet users indicated price and a wider selection of content available on the Internet as justifications for their behavior. Two-thirds of them pointed to such factors as availability without delays (typical of formal circulations, where global content arrives in Poland often with a delay) or the selection available.\n\n*Internet distribution impacts the way active internet users interact and use media formats. Only 8% of people who download music from the Internet download entire albums only; 31% download both albums and single files, while 61% download strictly single audio files. \n\n*The most commonplace attitude of active Internet users (50% of respondents) towards the informal circulations is moderate and focused on the broadening of cultural horizons. For them, the crucial factor is the ability to know more and see more, not acquire free content. \n\n*Additionally, two countervailing attitudes exist between fans of the informal circulation (8%), who think that \u201ceveryone\u2019s downloading content,\u201d and its staunchest critics (11%), who claim that downloading is theft and that the law should be more stringent with people who acquire content from the Internet via illegal means. \n\n*A fourth group (13%) claims that \u201cdownloading is simply easier.\u201d Interestingly, prices do not discourage them from acquiring content from the formal circulations, but rather the inconvenience of using the formal channels, that are not present when engaging the informal ones.", "comparative": 0, "intervention_response": "Policy implications:\n\n*Considering the extent of the informal circulation and its coexistence next to the formal circulation, cultural policy cannot be based on a binary separation of the two circulations, the people participating in them and stigmatization of one group. \n\n*Cultural policy cannot be based on the assumption that one circulation will be replaced by the other and we can\u2019t let that happen. If we do, then we will arrive at the conclusion that this substitution is furthered not only by the negatively-branded Internet phenomena, but also by the commonplace sharing of  content in the household, and even the activity of public cultural institutions, the latter also enabling us to access content via non-market means. \n\n*We\u2019re already facing situations where access to content that\u2019s allowed from the standpoint of the Polish legal system is hindered by technological instruments. The state, with its instruments that are supposed to regulate that sphere, has to look for balance between the interest of copyright owners and the public good. Favoring either side of the issue is completely unacceptable. \n\n*Cultural policy should be based on the assumption that multiple content circulations can coexist and might frequently overlap. And the goal of cultural policy should be the establishment of institutions and cultural frameworks that will harness these various circulations to foster creativity, as well as the possibility to use it, while remaining grounded in facts and considering the arguments of all involved parties.", "url": "http://www.copyrightevidence.org/evidence-wiki/index.php/Filiciak,_Hofmokl_and_Tarkowski_(2012)", "type": "Study", "government_or_policy": 0, "abstract": "The report \u201cCirculations of Culture.

We focused our study on the comparison of formal and informal circulations of cultural content, in the form of either digital or cultural copies. We decided not to \nstudy broadcast media use, due to the lack of circulating copies that allow comparisons with informal circulations online. \nYet the public discussion, revolving around file sharing networks and more broadly \naround obtaining and making use of cultural content in a digital form, usually situates these practices on the margin of typical activities of Poles.

And also to show the cultural and social aspects of this \nphenomenon that go beyond the question of its legality. First and foremost, we seek \nto explain why informal circulations of culture in digital form are an important issue for research on contemporary culture. Secondly, we stress that exploration into this issue provides important evidence for cultural policy.\nThe goal of our project was purely exploratory \u2013 instead of making rigid assumptionsin order to verify them, we decided to analyze the answers that the respondents put down in the questionnaires, their attitudes, and the opinions they expressed. This approach sought to help us understand how often, in what way, and why \nPoles engage with informal content circulations. \nMost importantly, we chose not to distinguish nor discriminate between legal and\nillegal circulations \u2013 mainly because the border between the two is often fuzzy and \nunclear for people who participate in either of them. Therefore, this is not a report \nabout \u201cpirates\u201d that conduct illegal activities, but rather about people who engage in informal content sharing practices. \nBut abandoning the simple legal-illegal binary has yet another reason. The goal of this report is to foster real dialogue on the issue of acquiring cultural content in Poland. The overuse of labels such as \u201cpiracy\u201d or \u201ctheft\u201d will not improve the chances of establishing such dialogue. An opposition between \u201cformal\u201d and \u201cinformal\u201d is in our opinion a much better way for framing this debate.\nWe conducted a quantitative, survey study and one of our primary goal was to \nestablish the scale and general character of the informal content circulation \u2013\nespecially the distribution of digital formats. The project consisted of two surveys. The first one, a pilot survey, was conducted through computer-assisted personal \ninterviews between May 19 and May 26 of 2011 on a sample of 1004 people over 15 \nyears of age, which was representative for the Polish population. \nThe goal of this survey was to describe the scale and basic characteristics of informal circulation in the whole Polish society. We were in particular interested in differences between Internet users and non-users, and between age groups. \nThe second survey was conducted over the Internet through computer-assisted web interviewson a sample of 1283 people. The survey was conducted on a random \nnationwide sample and the demographic structure of the analyzed set was representative of the Polish Internet user population (according to Nettrack) with \nrespect to gender, age (16 to 50 years old), place of residence, and education. \nWe have focused upon the population of Internet users based on the results of the first survey, according to which non-users do not participate in circulations of digital content.", "entities": ["Polish_language", "Second_Polish_Republic", "Standpoint_(magazine)", "Computer-assisted_personal_interviewing", "Public_good", "Creativity", "Millward_Brown", "Copyright_infringement", "Publicis", "Internet", "Cultural_policy", "Law_of_Poland", "Kent_Recursive_Calculator", "Circulate"], "country": ["Poland"], "authentic_link": "http://obiegikultury.centrumcyfrowe.pl/en", "citation_count": null, "literature_review": 0, "industries": ["Publishing of books, periodicals and other publishing", "Software publishing (including video games)", "Film and motion pictures", "Sound recording and music publishing"], "disciplines": ["Behavioral Microeconomics \u2022 Underlying Principles"], "year": 2012.0, "label": "The circulations of culture - on social distribution of content", "policies": ["Enforcement", "Licensing and Business models"], "link": "http://obiegikultury.centrumcyfrowe.pl/the_circulations_of_culture_report.pdf"}, {"collection_methods": ["Experimental (laboratory)"], "data_description": "A total of 223 students from the University of East Anglia (UEA), in Norwich, U.K., took part in the experiment.

In this area, because the Federal Circuit allows software to be claimed based on its function rather than on its more detailed technical workings, infringement can be found when two computer programs serve the same function, even if the software works in very different ways.81 A consumer or ordinary reasonable observer might use the purpose the software serves to assess similarity more generally, but a software expert would not.With few exceptions, then, the expert is the audience for patent infringement. For this audience choice to work, the fact finder must be able to put herself in the position of the expert. Patent law tries to address this challenge by relying on expert witnesses to explain the technology while limiting the amount of post hoc expert testimony on the meaning of patent claims and relying instead on documentary materials in existence at the time of patent filing. Patent law also gives the judge the role of assigning meaning to patent terms. Even though that job is really fact finding, not legal interpretation, it is arguably better suited to judges than juries because of their increased exposure to patent-infringement suits.\n\n* Copyright law\u2019s use of varied infringement audiences is confused and often depends on the particular circuit deciding the case. As a general matter, however, copyright uses a hybrid test, drawing on both the perspective of the expert and that of a nonexpert observer (either the consumer or the ordinary person).\n\n* Patent and trademark are virtual antipodes when it comes to the audience used to assess infringement. Patent law focuses on a hypothetical audience of experts, while trademark law ostensibly cares about both actual consumers\u2019 reactions and the defendant\u2019s subjective intent. The test for infringement of a design patent draws much more from trademark than from patent law. Infringement is judged in the eye of an ordinary observer, giving such attention as a purchaser usually gives. This test evokes an actual audience composed of reasonable purchasers, just as the trademark test does. But the audience is asked a different question. Despite the fact that the Supreme Court has spoken of \u201cthe resemblance . . . such as to deceive such an observer, inducing him to purchase one supposing it to be the other,\u201d the Federal Circuit has held that in design patent law, it is the similarity between the claimed design and the defendant\u2019s product, not the likelihood of confusion, that determines infringement. The result is a hybrid: the consumer audience from trademark law, asked to make the rather more abstract assessment of expert-based technical similarity from patent or copyright law. \n\n* Because consumers as a class tend to focus on whether the uses for two products are interchangeable, the consumer is likely to be the audience that most directly measures whether the plaintiff\u2019s work and the defendant\u2019s work at issue in IP litigation substitute for one another in the marketplace. When the consumer is the audience for IP infringement, then, market substitutes are more likely to be deemed infringing and thus third parties will be discouraged from producing substitutes without permission from the rights holder. For this reason, the consumer is an ideal audience choice for assessing IP infringement when that form of IP law seeks to discourage third parties from creating or distributing market substitutes of works protected by an IP right.\n\n* Different audiences (and fact finders, for that matter) can readily provide varying determinations on infringement. The choice of audience therefore ought to be made carefully with regard to the desired goals of each form of IP law. Understanding this fact helps explain many of the differences in IP infringement doctrine.", "comparative": 0, "intervention_response": "As a normative matter, the authors argue that IP infringement\u2014across trademark, patent, copyright, and design patent laws\u2014should generally require proof both that the two works are sufficiently similar in their novel aspects (technical similarity) and that the defendant\u2019s use interferes with the plaintiff\u2019s market (market substitution). Many of the problems in IP law come from decisions that neglect one aspect or the other. Thus, \u201cthe audience\u201d in IP infringement is properly a hybrid: a domain expert who can assess similarity and a consumer who can assess substitutability. Copyright law has internalized this lesson, albeit imperfectly. Patent, trademark, and design patent laws can all learn from its example.", "url": "http://www.copyrightevidence.org/evidence-wiki/index.php/Fromer_and_Lemley_(2013)", "type": "Study", "government_or_policy": 0, "abstract": "Every IP right has its own definition of infringement. In this paper, we suggest that this diversity of legal rules is largely traceable to differences in the audience in IP cases. Patent, trademark, copyright, and design patent each focus on a different person as the fulcrum for evaluating IP infringement. The fact that patent law focuses on an expert audience while trademark looks to a consumer audience explains many of the differences in how patent and trademark cases are decided. Expert audiences are likely to evaluate infringement based on the technical similarity between the plaintiff\u2019s and defendant\u2019s works. Consumers, by contrast, are likely to pay more attention to market substitution and less attention to how things work under the hood.

That is, 7.52 percent indicate that they exclusively publish IP articles, and another 8.89 percent indicated that they frequently publish IP articles. An overwhelming proportion of journals in the sample indicated that they do publish IP articles but only occasionally (32.61 percent) or rarely (34.78 percent). A significant proportion indicated that they do not publish IP articles (16.30 percent).\n\n*The sample contains a substantial majority of journals who make their article content available online before or contemporaneous with the publication of an issue (71.43 percent), while 9.89 percent indicated that online publication was not immediate or depended on the circumstances. Last, 17.58 percent of journals in our sample indicated that their policy is not to make journal content publicly available online.\n\n* In terms general copyright practices on average, they observe that practices of journals in our sample vary greatly with regard to their copyright assignment and public dissemination policies. For instance, while most journals do not ask authors to assign copyright in their articles (48.91 percent), almost as many journals do ask authors to assign copyright in their articles (42.39 percent). Also, most journals in the sample ask authors not to publicly disseminate their article before publication: 21.98 percent of journals prohibit public dissemination before publication, 14.29 percent ask but do not require authors not to publicly disseminate articles before publication, and 21.98 percent of journals will ask authors not to publicly disseminate depending on the circumstances. However, 38.46 percent of journals responding to the survey do not ask authors not to publicly disseminate their work prior to publication. \n\n* More consensus among journals in the sample emerges around the issues of exclusive publication, republication credits, and third party republication agreements. Most journals (52.22 percent) require authors to sign an exclusive publication agreement. Only 25.56 percent of journals do not ask authors to sign exclusive publication agreements at all, while 20.00 percent do ask authors to sign exclusive publication agreements but--depending on the circumstances--do not require the author\u2019s exclusive publication agreement. Additionally, an overwhelming majority of journals (73.63 percent) require credits upon the republication of the author\u2019s article, and 10.99 percent ask authors for a republication credit but may not require it, leaving just 12.09 percent of journals that do not ask for such a credit. Finally, responses show that journals in the sample tend to grant third parties to republish or otherwise distribute the journals\u2019 articles. While most journals grant third party republication permission with a credit (43.96 percent), others require payment of a licensing fee (8.79 percent), while others yet permit third party republication without restriction (4.40 percent). A significant number of journals indicated that third party republication permission depended on the circumstances (29.67 percent), while 5.49 percent of journals do not allow third party re-publication. Finally, 7.69 percent of journals responded that they did not know whether their journal allowed third party re-publication.\n\n* The analysis suggests that legacy policies at law journals may create unnecessary barriers to open access as well as impact scholars\u2019 abilities to use certain kinds of materials in their articles. This is evidenced by the significant number of journal respondents indicating that they: (1) require copyright transfers; (2) exclusive copyright agreements; and (3) not permitting the public dissemination of articles by the author prior to publication.

According to this critique, the over-expansion of IP rights throughout the past two decades harms competition, chills free speech, and diminishes the public domain as increasingly broad areas of social life are brought within the scope of strong IP protection. While this over-expansion theory reflects an important - indeed, foundational - policy debate concerning the proper balance between IP owners' rights and the public's rights of access to the information, ideas, and expressions\nthat IP protects, it is incomplete because it focuses largely on what Congress or the courts do. In reality, most enforcement of IP rights takes place not in court, but in the everyday practices of IP owners and their lawyers. \\\"Cease and desist\\\" letters, phone calls, and negotiations with alleged infringers constitute the bulk of IP enforcement efforts in trademark and copyright practice. To be sure, these efforts take place in the \\\"shadow\\\" of IP law and are therefore influenced by it. But it is in these everyday practices - and not in trial or appellate courts - that most IP rights are asserted, resisted, and negotiated. Thus, if we want to know whether IP rights are over-enforced or over-extended, we need to know how, why, and to what effect these\nrights are exercised in the everyday practices of IP owners and their lawyers. To date, however, IP scholarship has focused virtually no attention on this critical arena of everyday practice. This Article presents findings from a qualitative empirical study of the trademark and copyright disputing process outside of court, based on original data derived from semi-structured interviews with experienced\nIP attorneys who advise clients on how to enforce their rights. This research is one of the first studies to examine how trademark and copyright claims are actually enforced in practice. One significant finding from this study is that \\\"repeat player\\\" trademark and copyright owners (and their lawyers) knowingly assert weak IP claims at times - precisely because it works, as enforcement targets are unable or unwilling to resist claims that may lack legal merit due to the costs and uncertainties of threatened litigation. Moreover, the lawyers who assert weak IP claims have ready practical and ethical justifications for their actions. This study also suggests that legal sanctions directed at deterring over-reaching IP enforcement are unlikely to be effective because most such over-reaching occurs in informal disputing processes outside of the legal system.", "entities": ["First_Amendment_to_the_United_States_Constitution", "In_Reality", "Intellectual_property", "The_Remaining", "Public_domain", "Policy_debate"], "country": ["United States of America"], "authentic_link": "http://www.lexisnexis.com.ezproxy.lib.gla.ac.uk/uk/legal/search/homesubmitForm.do", "citation_count": null, "literature_review": 0, "industries": ["Creative, arts and entertainment"], "disciplines": ["Law and Economics", "Basic Areas of Law", "Property Law", "Legal Procedure; the Legal System; and Illegal Behavior", "Illegal Behavior and the Enforcement of Law"], "year": 2012.0, "label": "Trademark and Copyright Enforcement in the Shadow of IP Law", "policies": ["Enforcement"], "link": "http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1990588"}, {"collection_methods": ["Quantitative Collection Methods", "Survey Research (quantitative; e.g. sales/income reporting)"], "data_description": "Field survey data from questionnaires completed by 566 students or employees of three universities in Singapore, 2003-04.", "analysis_methods": ["Quantitative Analysis Methods", "Cluster analysis", "Factor Analysis", "Decision Tree Method"], "authors": "Gan and Koh (2006)", "issues": ["Understanding consumption/use"], "entity_count": {"Copyright_infringement": 1, "Decision_tree": 1, "Factor_analysis": 1, "Singapore": 1, "Intellectual_property": 1, "Ethics": 1, "Ethnic_Malays": 1}, "wordcount": {"cluster": 1, "attitudes_towards": 1, "perceptions": 1, "survey": 1, "age": 1, "usage": 1, "showed_that": 1, "profile": 1, "respondents": 1, "software": 2, "demographic": 1, "responses": 1, "factors": 1, "frequently": 1, "ambiguous": 1, "publishers": 1, "mainly": 1, "computer": 3, "to_pirate": 1, "groups": 2, "often": 1, "universities": 1, "less": 1, "decision": 1, "three": 2, "pirates": 2, "pirate": 1, "general": 1, "variables": 1, "used": 2, "frequent": 1, "demonstrated": 1, "influenced_by": 1, "able_to": 1, "staff": 1, "acceptance": 1, "university": 2, "least": 1, "students": 2, "Singapore": 2, "experience": 1, "underlying": 1, "attempt_to": 1, "software_piracy": 3, "convenience": 1, "examine": 1, "method": 1, "related": 2, "Also": 1, "older": 1, "means": 1, "negatively": 1, "identify": 1, "ethics": 1, "relationship": 1, "employees": 1, "Moreover": 1}, "plain_text_proposition": "Cluster analysis defines three groups of software pirates within Singapore\u2019s universities, each group having a very different profile: Frequent pirates, Infrequent pirates and Occasional pirates.\nEach group is defined by significant differences in their attitudes towards a range of factors related to software piracy: attitudes towards software publishers, acceptance of piracy, convenience, ethics and property rights protection\n\nThese demographic and computer-related variables have significant relationships with software piracy:\n\n# Age is the most important demographic variable across the three groups.

Less than one-fourth of copyright holders granted permission to digitize their books. Nearly one-third of copyright holders did not respond to queries, even after diligent follow-up. Addresses could not be found for about 11 percent of the copyright holders.

A significant amount of literature has been published on the application of competition rules to premium content rights agreements, but the specific obstacles encountered by new media platforms have been relatively unexplored. This paper seeks to fill this gap in the literature. \n\nThe European Commission (hereafter, the Commission) has recognised in its decisions that premium content is an \\\"essential input\\\" for operators active in the delivery of audio-visual content. There is indeed no substitution possible with other less attractive forms of content. In fact, premium content such as major football events represents \\\"stand-alone\\\" driver content for pay-TV operators. Absent access to such content it is very difficult for a content delivery operator to gain or retain market shares. Access to premium content is thus a matter of life or death for such operators. \n\nYet, getting access to premium content is not an easy matter. First, premium content is scarce as there are only a few blockbusters and a limited number of premium sport events every year. Moreover, premium content rights contracts usually involve some form of exclusivity pursuant to which dominant pay-TV operators often manage to monopolize such rights for several years at the expense of weaker competitors. The combination of scarcity and exclusivity has translated into a spiralling of the costs involved in buying premium content. For instance, while in 1992, broadcasters paid 434 million euros for the TV rights of the English Premier League, in 2000, they paid 2,6 billion euros for only three seasons. \n\nThe lack of access to premium content represents a significant handicap for new entrants, such as new media platforms. If these platforms want to gain market share, they need to show programmes, which are able to compete with the content shown by dominant pay-TV operators. Access foreclosure to premium content would thus not only prevent new entries from taking place in the highly concentrated pay-TV market, but would also affect technological developments and consumer choice as the latter would be prevented from watching their favourite programmes on the platform of their choice. Thus, in a number of policy speeches, Commission officials have insisted on the importance that new media platforms gain access to premium content. \n\nThe main argument followed throughout the paper is that, while recent Commission decisions contain remedies, which will help new media platforms to gain access to premium content, such remedies are insufficient to create a level playing field in the market for the acquisition of such content. Numerous anti-competitive practices continue to plague this market and further competition law intervention is thus required.", "entities": ["Spiralling", "Pay_television", "Foreclosure", "European_Commission", "Competition_law", "Premier_League", "The_Combination", "Association_football", "Black_Death", "Anti-competitive_practices", "UEFA"], "country": ["Austria", "Belgium", "Bulgaria", "Croatia", "Cyprus", "Czech Republic", "Denmark", "Estonia", "Finland", "France", "Germany", "Greece", "Hungary", "Ireland", "Italy", "Latvia", "Lithuania", "Luxembourg", "Malta", "Netherlands", "Poland", "Portugal", "Romania", "Slovakia", "Slovenia", "Spain", "Sweden", "United Kingdom"], "authentic_link": null, "citation_count": null, "literature_review": 0, "industries": ["Programming and broadcasting", "Creative, arts and entertainment", "Television programmes"], "disciplines": ["Monopoly \u2022 Monopolization Strategies", "Oligopoly and Other Imperfect Markets", "Monopolization \u2022 Horizontal Anticompetitive Practices", "Economics of Regulation", "Entertainment \u2022 Media"], "year": 2004.0, "label": "Access to content by new media platforms: a review of the competition law\nproblems", "policies": ["Licensing and Business models"], "link": "http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=617265"}, {"collection_methods": ["Quantitative Collection Methods", "Longitudinal study", "Qualitative Collection Methods", "Case study"], "data_description": "The empirical dataset consists of 446 federal copyright publication opinions decided before 2011.", "analysis_methods": ["Quantitative Analysis Methods", "Regression analysis", "Qualitative Analysis Methods", "Legal Analysis"], "authors": "Gerhardt (2014)", "issues": ["Relationship between protection", "Harmony of interest assumption between authors and publishers"], "entity_count": {"Federal_Cases": 1, "Supreme_Court_of_the_United_States": 1, "Wrong_Turn": 1, "Risk_aversion": 1, "Public_domain": 1, "First_Amendment_to_the_United_States_Constitution": 1, "BDSM": 1, "GeneRally": 1}, "wordcount": {"determining": 2, "fundamental": 1, "neither": 1, "boundaries": 1, "made_available": 1, "took": 1, "copyright": 9, "these_two": 1, "values": 1, "institutions": 1, "penalties": 1, "solution": 4, "needed": 2, "leading": 3, "public": 3, "value": 1, "preventing": 1, "Drawing_on": 1, "Supreme_Court": 1, "use": 4, "new": 1, "intent": 1, "ambiguity": 2, "cultural": 2, "publication": 5, "decision": 1, "copyright_law": 1, "patterns": 1, "would": 1, "without": 1, "assume": 2, "suggested": 1, "definition": 2, "standard": 2, "may_be": 1, "examines": 1, "sense": 1, "critically": 2, "I": 1, "archives": 1, "recent": 1, "alternatives": 1, "expression": 1, "cultural_heritage": 1, "history": 1, "wrong": 1, "statutory": 2, "meaning": 1, "unpublished": 1, "cases": 1, "law": 1, "discourse": 1, "generally": 1, "factors": 1, "films": 1, "First": 1, "way": 1, "doctrine": 1, "are_likely": 1, "better": 1, "art": 1, "today": 1, "best": 2, "provides": 1, "Unfortunately": 1, "historical": 3, "shows": 1, "federal": 3, "turn": 1, "uncertainty": 2, "public_domain": 7, "works": 7, "first": 1, "described": 1, "published": 5, "variables": 1, "empirical_analysis": 1, "publishing": 1, "materials": 1, "ambiguous": 1, "significant": 1, "type": 1, "copies": 1, "result": 1, "given": 1, "risk": 1, "most_important": 1, "often": 1, "finds_that": 1, "availability": 1, "work": 6, "original": 1, "critical": 1, "important": 1, "considering": 1, "notice": 2, "suggests_that": 1, "authorized": 1, "sharing": 1, "proposed": 1, "whether": 3, "used": 1, "documents": 1, "this_Article": 1, "much": 1, "film": 1, "Article": 2, "focuses_on": 1, "several": 1, "dedicated": 1, "museums": 2, "copyright_owner": 1, "content": 1, "unauthorized": 1, "importance": 1, "point": 1, "protected_by": 2, "research": 1, "educational": 1, "fill": 1, "photographs": 1, "identify": 2, "libraries": 2, "actually": 1, "free": 1}, "plain_text_proposition": "* In the six categories of text, 2D art, 3D art, music, film and all, district courts found works to be published 71% of the time.\n* With visual art, courts often found publication.

Knowing whether a photo, painting, film, or original letter was published is critically important to anyone who wants to use it today. Before 1989, publishing a work with no copyright notice dedicated the work to the public domain. Unpublished works without a notice are likely protected by copyright, and their unauthorized use can result in severe federal penalties. Unfortunately, the meaning of \u201cpublication\u201d in copyright law is notoriously ambiguous. The federal statutory definition suggests that works \u201cmade available\u201d to the public are published, while leading treatises generally assume that works given to public museums and libraries are unpublished. Confronted with this uncertainty, risk averse institutions too often assume that archived works are protected by copyright. Misunderstanding the law can keep cultural treasures locked in dark archives, vaults and basements, preventing their use as a foundation for new expression and distorting our sense of history.\n\nThis Article critically examines mistaken assumptions about copyright publication. It finds that neither the statutory definition nor leading treatises adequately identify when a work is published. A better standard for determining when a work is published and in the public domain is needed to free works from being locked up by copyright uncertainty. The best solution would clarify the boundaries of a stable public domain. In a recent decision, the Supreme Court took a wrong turn in dismissing the importance of the public domain. Knowing what content may be freely used is critical to preserving First Amendment values and freeing cultural treasures from copyright\u2019s bondage. The copyright ambiguity of archived works should be resolved in a way that honors the expressive and historical value of the public domain. After considering several alternatives, this Article shows how precedential patterns point to the best solution to the publication ambiguity. Drawing on empirical analysis of federal cases interpreting copyright publication, I identify the variables that are most important in determining whether archived works are published. The suggested solution focuses on copyright owner intent and the availability of authorized copies. Other factors described as significant in leading treatises \u2014 such as the type of work or archive \u2014 actually mask these two fundamental inquiries.

Books, magazines, films, software and plays, as well as works of art, architecture, music, and even choreography may be protected by copyright. For works created before 1976, knowing whether a work is published is often necessary for determining whether it is in the public domain so that anyone can use it, copy it or adapt it in other media without risking copyright liability. A court\u2019s determination of whether a work is published also may be dispositive of issues such as the duration of the copyright, if others can make fair use of it and whether, in litigation, statutory damages and attorney\u2019s fees are available. Despite the obvious import of this concept, it remains one of the most ambiguous features of copyright law. How do judges decide whether a creative work is published? This article presents the first comprehensive and systematic answer to that question. Based on a dataset of federal judicial opinions, this article analyzes the extent to which accepted notions of copyright publication conform with legal doctrine. The results reveal that often they do not. In particular, this article demonstrates that publication has a surprisingly inconsistent meaning across copyright issues, differing dramatically between the public domain and fair use contexts. The analysis shows that the characteristics of the work, as well as how it is distributed and accessed are important to courts when deciding whether a work is in the public domain. These findings are especially noteworthy, since contrary to popular belief, courts increasingly encounter the issue of publication when answering a wide variety of copyright questions.

Prior research suggests that the moral component is an integral part of attitude and the empirical data strongly support this claim.\n\n*Risk-taking personal identity is positively related to one's attitude toward softlifting. However, this relationship is only moderately significant (a = 0.10), and only in the school setting. \n\n*Gender was not a significant factor in any setting. Previous research finds that males had a more favorable attitude towards software piracy than females, and suggests that one possible explanation might be that males were greater risk-takers. This study finds evidence to support the explanation offered by those prior studies.\n\n*Legal personal identity is negatively related to one's attitude toward softlifting but this relation is only moderately significant (a = 0.10), and only in the work setting. The ability to detect this effect may be limited by the single-item measure used in this study. Nonetheless, the results support the expectation of a negative effect of legal personal identity on attitude; this seems a promising avenue for further research.\n\n*Awareness of the law is significant in reducing a favorable attitude toward softlifting, but only at school, where a student runs a greater risk of loss of privileges or a blemish on his or her record.\n\n*The research model is able to explain over 60% of the variance in attitude toward softlifting in all settings. Prior studies involving the Theory of Reasoned Action, the Theory of Planned Behavior and the Technology Acceptance Model have shown that attitude is an important determinant of behavioral intention. \n\n*It is therefore important to understand the determinants of attitude in order to comprehend the reasons that such behavior exists. This model demonstrates that with a behavior that has a moral component (such as softlifting), personal moral attitude and legal personal identity are important in explaining attitude toward the behav- ior. \n\n*Additionally, perceived usefulness is significant as well. This model could possibly be useful in predicting other behaviors that include a strong moral component.\n\n*In addition to significant findings regarding the determinants of attitude toward softlifting, this research shows that when examining software piracy behavior, setting matters. Future research along these lines could produce intriguing results.", "comparative": 0, "intervention_response": "Policy implications: \n\n*A more effective approach to curtailing software piracy may be to gain a fuller understanding of how the roots of that behavior, specifically intention to commit software piracy and the antecedents of intent are formed among individuals.

These factors are examined across multiple settings expected to be pertinent to our survey respondents: home, work and school. Personal moral obligation and perceived usefulness are significant predictors of attitude across all settings. Past behavior is a significant predictor of intention across all settings, and a significant predictor of attitude in the home setting. We find evidence that awareness of the law causes a less favorable evaluation of softlifting in the school setting only, but has little effect in the home and work settings.

There should be no accompanying levies for consumers.\n\n* Allow private copying for research to cover all forms of content. This relates to the copying, not the distribution, of media.\n\n* Amend s.42 of the CDPA by 2008 to permit libraries to copy the master copy of all classes of work in permanent collection for archival purposes and to allow further copies to be made from the archived copy to mitigate against subsequent wear and tear.\n\n* Enable libraries to format shift archival copies by 2008 to ensure records do not become obsolete.\n\n* Propose that Directive 2001/29/EC be amended to allow for an exception for creative, transformative or derivative works, within the parameters of the Berne Three Step Test.\n\n* Create an exception to copyright for the purpose of caricature, parody or pastiche by 2008. \n\n* Propose a provision for orphan works to the European Commission, amending Directive 2001/29/EC.\n\n* The Patent Office should issue clear guidance on the parameters of a \u2018reasonable search\u2019 for orphan works, in consultation with rights holders, collecting societies, rights owners and archives, when an orphan works exception comes into being.\n\n* The Patent Office should establish a voluntary register of copyright; either on its own, or through partnerships with database holders, by 2008.\n\n* Match penalties for online and physical copyright infringement by amending section 107 of the CDPA by 2008.\n\n* Monitor success of current measures to combat unfair competition in cases relating to IP, and if changes are found to be ineffective, Government should consult on appropriate changes.\n\n* DCA should review the issues raised in its forthcoming consultation paper on damages and seek further evidence to ensure that an effective and dissuasive system of damages exists for civil IP cases and that it is operating effectively.

And yet IP is everywhere. Even a simple coffee jar relies on a range of IP rights \u2013 from patents to copyright, designs to trade marks.\n\nIn the modern world, knowledge capital, more than physical capital, drives the UK economy. Against the backdrop of the increasing importance of ideas, IP rights, which protect their value, are more vital than ever. The ideal IP system creates incentives for innovation, without unduly limiting access for consumers and follow on innovators. It must strike the right balance in a rapidly changing world so that innovators can see further by standing on the shoulders of giants.\n\nThe Government\u2019s decision to commission this Review was an explicit recognition both of the growing importance of IP and of the challenges brought by the changing economic environment. In commissioning the Review, the Chancellor and the Secretaries of State for Trade and Industry, and Culture, Media and Sport asked me to establish whether the system was fit for purpose in an era of globalisation, digitisation and increasing economic specialisation.\n\nThe answer is a qualified \u2018yes\u2019. I do not think the system is in need of radical overhaul. However, taking a holistic view of the system, I believe there is scope for reform to serve better the interests of consumers and industry alike. There are three areas in which the Review concentrates its recommendations to improve the UK framework for innovation:\n\n\u2022 strengthening enforcement of IP rights, whether through clamping down on piracy or trade in\ncounterfeit goods;\n\u2022 reducing costs of registering and litigating IP rights for businesses large and small; and\n\u2022 improving the balance and flexibility of IP rights to allow individuals, businesses and institutions to use\ncontent in ways consistent with the digital age.\n\nMuch IP policy is framed by European, and indeed global, treaties and agreements. I recognise that not all the recommendations are within the direct purview of the UK Government. However, I have not shied away from making recommendations with European or broader international import when they seemed necessary. Indeed, with the European Commission currently reviewing both the copyright acquis and the question of a Community patent, this is a timely point at which to put forward the Review\u2019s arguments. \n\nI would like to express my thanks to all those who assisted me in producing this Review. Many individuals and organisations gave generously of their time to contribute insights, and in particular the great diversity and depth of responses to the Call for Evidence were invaluable. I owe a special debt to the Review team, who have supported me throughout: Richard Sargeant, Steve Coles, Alastair Cowie, Suzy Kantor, Nicola Kay, Stephen Rowan and Nathan Sansom.\n\nI hope this Review provides sound recommendations on how the IP regime should respond to the challenges that it faces. Getting the balance right is vital to driving innovation, securing investment and stimulating competition. Lasting success will belong to those who get this right.", "entities": ["Physical_capital", "Caricature", "European_Patent_Litigation_Agreement", "Chartered_Trading_Standards_Institute", "Patent", "Disbarment", "Format_shifting", "Copyright_collective", "Globalization", "Division_of_labour", "Stephen_Clegg_Rowan", "Copyright_Directive", "Distance_education", "Intellectual_Property_Office_(United_Kingdom)", "George_Bailey_Sansom", "City_of_London", "Orphan_works", "Coffee", "Intellectual_property", "Trust_law", "Judicial_College", "Test_Act", "Bern", "Home_Office", "Secondary_source", "Database", "Gowers_Review_of_Intellectual_Property", "Contract", "Copyright_infringement", "Mystery_fiction", "Copyright_term", "Organized_crime", "Unitary_patent", "The_Answer_(band)", "University_of_Cambridge", "Government_of_the_United_Kingdom", "Drum_Corps_Associates", "Related_rights", "European_Commission", "Great_Britain", "Private_copying_levy", "Unfair_competition", "Pastiche", "Jargon", "Richard_I_of_England", "Counterfeit"], "country": ["United Kingdom"], "authentic_link": "https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/228849/0118404830.pdf", "citation_count": 15.0, "literature_review": 0, "industries": ["Creative, arts and entertainment", "Film and motion pictures", "Television programmes", "Sound recording and music publishing", "Programming and broadcasting", "Computer programming", "Specialised design", "Photographic activities", "Cultural education", "Software publishing (including video games)", "Publishing of books, periodicals and other publishing", "Translation and interpretation"], "disciplines": ["General Economics", "Intellectual Property and Intellectual Capital"], "year": 2006.0, "label": "Gowers Review of Intellectual Property", "policies": ["Nature and Scope of exclusive rights", "Exceptions", "Mass digitisation/orphan works"], "link": "https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/228849/0118404830.pdf"}, {"collection_methods": ["Survey Research (qualitative; e.g. consumer preferences)", "Case study", "Semi-structured interview"], "data_description": "In total, 1,858 micro firms (0-9 employees) and SMEs (10-249 employees) were contacted in the online survey and this received 170 responses, representing a 9.1% response rate, which is normal for such research.

The sample is gender-balanced with 48% female and 52% male, with a mean age of 21 years. The survey was based on a 40-item questionnaire related to music piracy and individual characteristics. The survey was conducted on a face-to-face basis.\n\nThe experiment was a standard public good game. The experimental market was composed of two types of participants: consumers and record producers. The experiment was completely decontextualized: endowments, profits and donations were printed on different colored tickets, and no reference was made to CDs or donations. At the beginning of the experiment, all agents received an endowment in colored tickets.\nThese colored tickets were exchanged for money at the end of the experiment following a set of rules.\nEach consumer was given yellow tickets. Half of the \u201cconsumers\u201d were given a large endowment and the other half a (very) low endowment. Each record producer was given red tickets. An official exchange rate (yellow tickets into red tickets) was given and all rules were made public to the participants. We focused on \u201cconsumer\u201d behavior\nin this experimental market. The consumers had to exchange their yellow tickets for red tickets. Red tickets held by \u201cconsumers\u201d at the end of each session were exchanged for real money at a 1-to-1 basis (1 red ticket = 1 euro). The record producers had to exchange their red tickets for yellow tickets. Each yellow ticket held by a \u201cproducer\u201d at the end of a session was exchanged for .66 euro. The sessions were organized as follows: 21 participants were involved in a session. The experiment took place in two different rooms (A and B). The participants were split into two groups, 20 consumers were in room A and one producer was in room B. \nThree sessions (one per treatment) were conducted with 63 participants in April 2006 in the Business School of Burgundy in Dijon.

When no donation mechanism is implemented, the number of exchanges is the lowest, the rate of piracy (measured by the non-respect of the official exchange rate) is the highest, the stated and effective exchange rate are the lowest, and, the level of ethical dissonance is the lowest.\n\n*In sum, donation does not reduce piracy for intermediate levels of transfer, which partly supports hypothesis \\\"The higher the donation level, the lower the piracy rate.\\\"\n\n*This result is consistent with the market survey, in which some individuals argued that profit-oriented firms are unlikely to devote intermediate or high percentages of proceeds to charitable causes. The relationship between donations (as a percentage of proceeds) and the level of piracy seems to follow a roughly U-shaped curve. \n\n*This result can be intuitively interpreted in terms of piracy elasticity.

This conclusion however was to be mitigated by the fact that many of these rights already existed prior to the Directive, albeit not in a harmonized European framework. \n*The right of making available has undoubtedly resulted in a large-scale redrafting of contracts to adapt to online markets. However, applying the terms of the Directive does not always lead to clear-cut results. To cite one example, it remains unclear and entails practical problems whether streaming is to fall under the right of making available or if it is to be counted under broadcasting rights.\n*The codification of a broad right of reproduction that includes temporary copying is widely perceived as having created obstacles to budding online business models. This stems from the fact that it has created an overlap with the right of communication to the public, which adds complexity to the licensing process and sometimes a need for \u2018double\u2019 licenses from concurrent rightholders or collecting societies. Indeed, it could be said that this aspect of the Directive has raised transaction costs. It was therefore suggested to further restrict the right of reproduction to the realm of physical copies.\n*The need to simplify cross-border licensing which is still tributary to national laws was also broached. One way to deal with this was to promote Community-wide licensing, as was being attempted by the Commission\u2019s Recommendation. Another, more fundamental approach would be to truly unify copyright norms by establishing a unified European copyright regime.\n*A clear need for a higher degree of harmonisation was certainly felt in the area of limitations. Most participants seemed to favour the introduction of a list of mandatory exceptions, possibly including certain non-overridable limitations. However, because many such exceptions are informed by cultural considerations, not everyone agreed such a mandatory list is desirable. Those who favoured a rapprochement with the American \u2018fair use\u2019 concept were countered with the argument that its flexibility could undermine legal certainty. It was agreed that consumer interests which are also reflected in certain exceptions to copyright should be dealt with primarily in the framework of consumer law.\n*The application of TPMs, in turn, has likely fostered the emergence of online business models as investment in online subscription services has apparently increased.

Digital unit sales were negligible before and increased from up 7.9 million in 2004 to 61.6 million in 2009, when they made up more than a third of the market for authorized copies of sound recordings. By 2012, the majority of unit sales were \u2018digital\u2019. Furthermore, income from subscription services and advertising-financed music streaming services online have been growing rapidly (not covered in Table 1). To be sure, in terms of retail value, the share of the digital market is lower, since average retail prices per unit in the digital market are lower. Nevertheless, it is clear that large parts of the legitimate market for recorded music has become \u2018digital\u2019 since 2004.\n\n*The most relevant observation for this paper is that growth in the number of record companies was relatively high before the popularization of digital retailing. The number of record companies expanded less rapidly in the period in which digital sales started to pick up. In the five years from 1999 to 2003, when authorized digital retailing had been negligible, the number of firms had expanded by an average of 68 firms per year. After the iTunes store had 18 started operating in 2004, digital retailing proliferated. From 2005 to 2009, the number of record companies increased on average by less than 12 firms per year, and by less than 21 firms per year for the entire period from 2005 to 2013. This is a striking difference from the years preceding digital retailing, especially because accumulated revenues from sales of sound recordings in Germany fell much more rapidly from 1999 to 2003 (physical and digital). Nominal revenues fell by over 34% in the five years before substantial digital retailing from 1999 and 2003 (BV Phono 2008). It fell by 12.5% in the five years after 2004, from 2005 to 2009, and by 16.9% in the nine years from 2005 to 2013 (BV Phono 2014). Of course, in a context of broader and disruptive technological change, other factors may be driving these developments. Nevertheless, the number of record companies increased more rapidly before digital retailing started taking up. It is thus improbable that digital retailing would have promoted market entry by record companies.", "comparative": 0, "intervention_response": "*Unauthorized digital copying does not only affect the appropriability for creators and rights holders. The empirical literature also indicates that digital copying has increased competition between suppliers of content, and the record industry has become more productive over recent years: while revenues have fallen considerably, the empirical literature to date suggests that the supply of new creative works has continued to increase rapidly (Waldfogel 2011, 2012; Handke 2012a). Digital retailing may co-determine this development, as it makes trading of copyright works more efficient. However, according to the evidence presented in this paper, digital retailing does not promote the position of newcomers and fringe suppliers, and is thus unlikely to promote competition between firms supplying copyright works. \n\n*The appropriability of copyright works does not only depend on end-user behaviour. It also depends on the bargaining position of rights holders with (other) intermediaries. The current understanding of markets for information services suggests that digital retailers are likely to acquire a dominant position in markets for copyright works. This paper presents preliminary empirical evidence of such a development. Market power of digital retailers is bound to undermine the prospects of creators and rights holders to appropriate much of the value of the works they supply.\n\n*In a context of digitization, it is not adequate for copyright policy to concentrate on control over the use of copyright works. In the economic perspective, copyright is a costly means to promote pecuniary incentives for content creation. There is little point in establishing exclusive rights over the use information goods if the rights holders are in no position to benefit from it because they face quasi-monopolistic intermediaries.", "url": "http://www.copyrightevidence.org/evidence-wiki/index.php/Handke_(2015)", "type": "Study", "government_or_policy": 0, "abstract": "How can copyright promote innovation in digital markets?

Unauthorized copying has ambiguous consequences: on the one hand, it affects the extent to which suppliers of reproducible creative works can appropriate the value of these intangible goods; on the other hand, unauthorized copying has increased competition between suppliers of creative works, and is associated with substantial productivity increases. Contrary to common expectations, our empirical evidence suggests that digital retailing is not associated with disintermediation and has not made the market for recorded music more contestable. Furthermore, the market power of Internet-based intermediaries can undermine the appropriability of creators, which has not yet been acknowledged in debates on copyright reforms. In this context, copyright policy that focuses on controlling unauthorized use can be ineffective.

Overall, professional content makes up a considerable share of YouTube material. It would be an exaggeration to claim that professional content is largely being replaced. In addition, a substantial minority of UGC in the broader sense, including the mixed forms, builds directly on the repertoire of commercial works.

First, data restrictions do not allow us to draw very firm conclusions. Second, it is difficult to distinguish the impact of copyright from the impact of broader technological change with digitization.\n\n*The findings presented here show that commonly voiced assumptions have no solid basis. There is no solid evidence that the diffusion of digital copying technology fundamentally would have damaged the supply of new works.

Accordingly, the relatively strict copyright protection in some countries does not seem to promote the supply of new creative works. The present report also considers whether user-generated content (UGC) complements or substitutes professional content. An increasing supply of valuable UGC is not reflected in official economic statistics. In all probability, copyright protection promotes user-generated content less than professional content. As a result, substituting professional content with \\\"amateur material\\\" could reduce the socially desirable strength of copyright protection. However, we find that almost half of all works available on YouTube are professional content. Professional works are watched and recommended more frequently than the average. In addition, a large proportion of UGC on YouTube draws on professional works. There is little evidence that professional content would be widely replaced.

sharply into focus as libraries, archives, and other large repositories of copyrighted works have sought to digitize and make available their collections online. Although this problem is certainly not limited to digital libraries, it has proven especially challenging for these organizations because they hold diverse collections that include millions of books, articles, letters, photographs, home movies, films, and other types of works. Many items come with a complex, unknown, and (often) unknowable history of copyright ownership. Because U.S. copyright law provides for both strong injunctive relief and monetary damages (in the form of statutory damages of up to $150,000 per work infringed), organizations that cannot obtain permission often do not make their collections available at all.\n\nIn October 2012, the U.S. Copyright Office initiated a new study of orphan works and mass digitization, and has indicated that it is a high-priority policy issue for the office. That study, and the work that preceded it, has highlighted the wide array of perspectives about why and how to address the orphan works problem. In this article, we present evidence that the orphan works problem is very real and that it inhibits many socially valuable uses of copyrighted works by libraries, archives, museums and other memory institutions. We then canvass the array of potential solutions, and ultimately conclude that fair use, combined with the Copyright Office\u2019s remedy limitation approach, are better approaches for addressing this problem in the United States than alternatives proposed elsewhere.

Moral consideration is one factor that might sway individuals to pay for files they could otherwise obtain for free. To help better understand how moral consideration works in the context of file sharing, this research examines how people form perceptions of the legality and ethicalness of downloading music files through file sharing. We propose that when people receive files in a more restrictive manner (e.g. streaming vs. downloading) they are less likely to recognize file sharing as being unethical or illegal. We conduct five studies to test our theory of restrictiveness. The results consistently indicate that consumers\u2019 perceptions of legality and ethicalness of file sharing are associated with restrictiveness of use. In particular, while file sharing with different levels of restrictiveness still transfers intellectual property from one individual to another, increased restrictiveness results in consumers being less likely to identify file sharing as being illegal or unethical. This in turn has a great impact on their actual engagement in the unauthorized file sharing activities.

A number of these a concerned largely with issues surrounding patent law. However, the majority are relevant to copyright policy.\n\n1. Evidence: Government should ensure that development of the IP System is driven as far as possible by objective evidence. Policy should balance measurable economic objectives against social goals and potential benefits for rights holders against impacts on consumers and other interests. These concerns will be of particular importance in assessing future claims to extend rights or in determining desirable limits to rights.\n\n2. International priorities: The UK should resolutely pursue its international interests in IP, particularly with respect to emerging economies such as China and India, based upon positions grounded in economic evidence. It should attach the highest immediate priority to achieving a unified EU patent court and EU patent system, which promises significant economic benefits to UK business. The UK should work to make the Patent Cooperation Treaty a more effective vehicle for international processing of patent applications.\n\n3. Copyright licensing:\n\u2022 In order to boost UK firms\u2019 access to transparent, contestable and global digital markets, the UK should establish a cross sectoral Digital Copyright Exchange. Government should appoint a senior figure to oversee its design and implementation by the end of 2012. A range of incentives and disincentives will be needed to encourage rights holders and others to take part. Governance should reflect the interests of participants, working to an agreed code of practice.\n\u2022 The UK should support moves by the European Commission to establish a framework for cross border copyright licensing, with clear benefits to the UK as a major exporter of copyright works. Collecting societies should be required by law to adopt codes of practice, approved by the IPO and the UK competition authorities, to ensure that they operate in a way that is consistent with the further development of efficient, open markets.\n\n4. Orphan works: The Government should legislate to enable licensing of orphan works. This should establish extended collective licensing for mass licensing of orphan works, and a clearance procedure for use of individual works. In both cases, a work should only be treated as an orphan if it cannot be found by search of the databases involved in the proposed Digital Copyright Exchange.\n\n5. Limits to copyright: Government should firmly resist over regulation of activities which do not prejudice the central objective of copyright, namely the provision of incentives to creators. Government should deliver copyright exceptions at national level to realise all the opportunities within the EU framework, including format shifting, parody, non-commercial research, and library archiving. The UK should also promote at EU level an exception to support text and data analytics. The UK should give a lead at EU level to develop a further copyright exception designed to build into the EU framework adaptability to new technologies. This would be designed to allow uses enabled by technology of works in ways which do not directly trade on the underlying creative and expressive purpose of the work. The Government should also legislate to ensure that these and other copyright exceptions are protected from override by contract.\n\n6. Patent thickets and other obstructions to innovation: In order to limit the effects of these barriers to innovation, the Government should:\n\u2022 take a leading role in promoting international efforts to cut backlogs and manage the boom in patent applications by further extending \u201cwork sharing\u201d with patent offices in other countries;\n\u2022 work to ensure patents are not extended into sectors, such as non-technical computer programs and business methods, which they do not currently cover, without clear evidence of benefit;\n\u2022 investigate ways of limiting adverse consequences of patent thickets, including by working with international partners to establish a patent fee structure set by reference to innovation and growth goals rather than solely by reference to patent office running costs. The structure of patent renewal fees might be adjusted to encourage patentees to assess more carefully the value of maintaining lower value patents, so reducing the density of patent thickets.\n\n7. The design industry: The role of IP in supporting this important branch of the creative economy has been neglected. In the next 12 months, the IPO should conduct an evidence based assessment of the relationship between design rights and innovation, with a view to establishing a firmer basis for evaluating policy at the UK and European level. The assessment should include exploration with design interests of whether access to the proposed Digital Copyright Exchange would help creators protect and market their designs and help users better achieve legally compliant access to designs.\n\n8. Enforcement of IP rights: The Government should pursue an integrated approach based upon enforcement, education and, crucially, measures to strengthen and grow legitimate markets in copyright and other IP protected fields. When the enforcement regime set out in the DEA becomes operational next year its impact should be carefully monitored and compared with experience in other countries, in order to provide the insight needed to adjust enforcement mechanisms as market conditions evolve. This is urgent and Ofcom should not wait until then to establish its benchmarks and begin building data on trends. In order to support rights holders in enforcing their rights the Government should introduce a small claims track for low monetary value IP claims in the Patents County Court.\n\n9. Small firm access to IP advice: The IPO should draw up plans to improve accessibility of the IP system to smaller companies who will benefit from it. This should involve access to lower cost providers of integrated IP legal and commercial advice.\n\n10. An IP system responsive to change: The IPO should be given the necessary powers and mandate in law to ensure that it focuses on its central task of ensuring that the UK\u2019s IP system promotes innovation and growth through efficient, contestable markets. It should be empowered to issue statutory opinions where these will help clarify copyright law. As an element of improved transparency and adaptability, Government should ensure that by the end of 2013, the IPO publishes an assessment of the impact of those measures advocated in this review which have been accepted by Government.", "url": "http://www.copyrightevidence.org/evidence-wiki/index.php/Hargreaves_(2011)", "type": "Study", "government_or_policy": 0, "abstract": "When the Prime Minister commissioned this review in November 2010, he did so in terms which some considered provocative. The Review was needed, the PM said, because of the risk that the current intellectual property framework might not be sufficiently well designed to promote innovation and growth in the UK economy.\n\nIn the five months we have had to compile the Review, we have sought never to lose sight of David Cameron\u2019s \u201cexam question\u201d. Could it be true that laws designed more than three centuries ago with the express purpose of creating economic incentives for innovation by protecting creators\u2019 rights are today obstructing innovation and economic growth?\n\nThe short answer is: yes. We have found that the UK\u2019s intellectual property framework, especially with regard to copyright, is falling behind what is needed. Copyright, once the exclusive concern of authors and their publishers, is today preventing medical researchers studying data and text in pursuit of new treatments. Copying has become basic to numerous industrial processes, as well as to a burgeoning service economy based upon the internet. The UK cannot afford to let a legal framework designed around artists impede vigorous participation in these emerging business sectors.\n\nThis does not mean, however, that we must put our hugely important creative industries at risk. Indeed, these businesses too need change, in the form of more open, contestable and effective global markets in digital content and a setting in which enforcement of copyright becomes effective once more.\n\nThe Review sets out how this can be achieved. We have focused upon the main issues, at the risk of ignoring important points of detail, and have tried to set out a clear, strategic argument, supported with just ten recommendations. We are also making available online a number of documents which explore the available evidence and submissions made to the Review. If the Review\u2019s recommendations are followed, the result will be more innovation and more economic growth.\n\nOur intellectual property framework will face further significant pressure to adapt in the coming years, as we make our way into the third decade of the commercial internet. We urge Government to ensure that in future, policy on Intellectual Property issues is constructed on the basis of evidence, rather than weight of lobbying, and to ensure that the institutions upon which we depend to deliver intellectual property policy have clear mandates and adaptive capability.

Accordingly, we conduct a laboratory experiment using teenagers and their parents as subjects, increasing the realism of the context by sampling potential pirates and their parents.

Interestingly, subjects respond negatively to advice from record labels over time, purchasing fewer songs as compared to other sources such as the subject's parent. The existence of a social tie between the adviser and the subject assists in mitigating piracy, especially when a parent is facing potential penalties due to his or her child's behavior.

led Copyright Hub based in the UK that links interoperably and scalably to the growing national and international network of private and public sector digital copyright exchanges, rights registries and other copyright-related databases, using agreed cross-sectoral and cross-border data building blocks and standards, based on voluntary, opt-in, non-exclusive and pro-competitive principles. \n\nThe Copyright Hub will serve in the UK and beyond a wide range of copyright licensors (rights holders, creators and rights owners in both commercial and cultural worlds) on the supply side and a wide range of copyright licensees/users on the demand side.\n\n\\\"If the industry and public authorities follow the recommendations in this report, we believe that this will put the UK in a leadership position in relation to innovative solutions for copyright licensing.\\\"", "comparative": 0, "intervention_response": "We recommend that:\n\n* Where international standard identifiers exist, e.g. in the publishing and music industries, that they should be used accurately and consistently to identify the work, its creator(s) and the accompanying rights.\n\n* Where such identifiers currently do not exist, e.g. for cross-media content and in the images industry, that relevant organisations work together, drawing on existing systems and practices, to agree an approach that works for the industries as a whole.\n\n* Recognising that the stripping of metadata on a commercial scale can already constitute a criminal offence as well as a civil infringement, we call on all web publishing organisations that regularly use and resize pictures, such as broadcasters and newspapers, to agree a voluntary code of practice in which they publicly commit to: (1) end the practice of stripping metadata from images and (2) refuse to use images for which there is no metadata attached.\n\n* And to the extent that it seems appropriate, we recommend that the Government works with the images industry, technology developers and other interested parties to find a practicable solution to this problem.\n\n* In the UK and internationally it is generally agreed that the databases of who owns what rights for what in which country are not fit for purpose for the demands of the digital age even if they were adequate for the less complex demands of the analogue age. We are supporting two main database projects which will also act as exemplars of what good looks like: the Global Repertoire Database in music publishing where Performing Rights Society (PRS for Music) has been a prime motivator and the Global Recording Database with a similar role played by Phonographic Performance Limited (PPL). The aspiration is for collecting societies around the world to be able to draw on one authoritative database which is kept updated (a key requirement for rights databases), replacing multiple databases where the data conflicts and is not kept up to date.\n\n* We are supporting the Linked Content Coalition (LCC), an international project that emanated from the European Publishers Council, but is now moving into new sectors beyond publishing. The LCC is all about developing a common language and a set of communications standards so proper interoperability is achieved, a very real and necessary building block for the Copyright Hub and its associated databases and DCEs.\n\n*We recommend that: The organisations engaged in licensing content to schools and colleges should offer these licences for sale through an intermediary or aggregator thus in effect creating a \u2018one stop shop\u2019 for licensing for educational institutions. This will reduce the number of individual organisations that educational institutions have to deal with to obtain licences (currently around twelve) and should reduce the transaction costs involved in this process.\n\n* We recommend: That the music industry continues to find ways to make the licensing of new digital services over the fixed and mobile internet easier, more automated where appropriate and more accessible. This is and will be done by new types of blanket licensing, by direct licensing and by combinations of blanket and direct licensing. The challenge of direct licensing is to keep the number of different organisations a licensee has to deal with to a sensible minimum. Aggregators and intermediaries play and will play an important role in meeting this challenge.\n\n* That the UK music industry working with the appropriate European organisations continues to pioneer easier ways of licensing across the single European market reducing the number of licensors wherever possible that prospective licensees have to deal with, thus helping to create a true single market across Europe for music.\n\n* We support the ARROW7 and ARROW Plus projects which demonstrate how due diligence in relation to orphan works can be done in an automated way by linking and searching libraries around the world. We especially support the possibility of the technology being usable beyond publishing, for example in the images industry where images without metadata quickly become orphan.\n\n* We recommend that the industries, especially the audiovisual industry where repertoire imbalance is the biggest issue, continue to reduce the problem of repertoire imbalance between the digital and physical worlds and thus counteract the perception of the problem.", "url": "http://www.copyrightevidence.org/evidence-wiki/index.php/Hooper_and_Lynch_(2012b)", "type": "Study", "government_or_policy": 0, "abstract": "Following a recommendation from Professor Ian Hargreaves to establish a cross sectoral Digital Copyright Exchange, the Government appointed Richard Hooper CBE in November 2011 to lead an independent review.

However, the correlation between the pirated quantity and CD player ownership was quite modest, and not statistically significant. Pirated music did not have a significant complementary effect on the demand for CD players, and hence it might not have contributed to the raising legitimate demand through an indirect network effect.\n\n*The authors estimated that piracy caused legitimate sales to fall by 0.0954 unit per capita.

Empirically, we find that the demand for music CDs decreased with piracy, suggesting that \\\"theft\\\" outweighed the \\\"positive\\\" effects of piracy.

However, while the online TV sector has been growing since 2009, traditional pay TV still accounts for the majority of TV revenues. Television has remained similarly resilient in the advertising market, where it maintains the highest share of advertising revenue across all media. \n\n* Online video is currently growing complementarily to TV advertising, but some cannibalization is starting to be observed in the European Nordic region. Television and video delivery platforms are becoming increasingly complex as viewing preferences move towards a world in which content is available on-demand and in a device agnostic manner. The move to digital from analogue delivery methods has been a key trend among traditional television platforms, since digitisation offers less constraint on the number of channels available to viewers. \n\n* The development of the internet has also seen the growth of online video platforms, which has given rise to changing behaviours of viewers around the world, as well as new competitors to traditional TV players. \n\n* Mobile video consumption is growing rapidly, driven by the growth in smartphone adoption and advanced 4G mobile data networks. However, direct monetisation of mobile video is challenging, with users opting for free services or video delivered as part of a wider premium pay TV or online video subscription, for which there is no additional fee for mobile access.\n\n* The digitisation of all content has unified delivery platforms, meaning that future technologies a more fluent interchange between different platforms. For example, a satellite TV image can interface with internet content delivered over mobile. This places pressure on video distribution to move towards higher quality video. The cost of this has two aspects: the availability of a network or spectrum to deliver, and the technologies needed to improve the efficiency of delivery over a given network.\n\n* For broadcasters, a drawback of the increasing prevalence of digital technologies and changing viewing behaviour is that the ease of obtaining unauthorised access to copyrighted content has increased. As a result of this, various types of piracy have arisen, which bring with them the risk of broadcasters losing control of their programming, as well as threatening the economics of intellectual property.

While some broadcasters \u2013 especially those in developing economies - still utilise traditional analogue transmission techniques, most have transitioned to more efficient and powerful digital means of sending their programming to viewers. Use of digital technologies has enabled explosive growth in the number of channels and choices of programmes offered. It has also ceded more control to the viewer, allowing on-demand access to programming \u2013 not only from broadcasters and pay TV service providers, but also increasingly from online video services delivered over the open Internet. Indeed, as this report outlines, the definitional boundaries between broadcasting and other forms of digital video delivery are increasingly blurred. \n\nThe viewer is undoubtedly a winner as a result of these developments as we move ever closer to the ultimate provision of ubiquitous choice, convenience and control. And broadcasters are usually winners too as evidenced by the impressive global TV market growth described in this report. Inevitably, that growth and technological development is not evenly distributed geographically, and we outline some of the key regional trends in the pages that follow, as well as some more focused snapshots of the market evolution within selected countries.\n\nHowever, this report also highlights a paradox at the heart of this technological revolution; namely, that the ceding of ever more control to the viewer also inevitably means an increasing risk that broadcasters lose control of their programming.

At the outset, the clearest implication of the demonstrated unsoundness of the incentive theory is that legal scholars, judges, and lawmakers should tighten their discourse. We should no longer tolerate easy assertions that intellectual goods need external incentives. Indeed, the current legal literature on intellectual property is rife with reliance on the incentive theory. It undergirds IP discourse generally. Today, as scholars weigh in about the future direction of intellectual property law, this great fallacy causes them to draw erroneous conclusions and to champion ill-considered changes in the law. \n\n*  Not Confusing the Exceptions with the Rule. There are undoubtedly exceptions. Valuable intellectual assets whose development almost certainly required the incentive of external rewards, such as those made possible by intellectual property rights, include virtually all large-budget major motion pictures,  virtually all large-budget television series, and many or most new  pharmaceutical compounds. The exceptions to the general rule of spontaneous creative labor, however, do not disprove the rule. Why not? The exceptions arise out  of the costs of production and distribution of creative and innovative labors, not the creative labor per se. \n\n* Sunsetting Intellectual Property Entitlements. Much of intellectual property law may ultimately be justifiable; that is, it may ultimately turn out, after data is gathered and carefully weighed, that a persuasive case can be made to justify wide swaths of entitlement-granting IP law. But, by the same token, most of intellectual property law is currently unjustified; that is, no such persuasive case has been presently put forth.  The legal doctrines of patent and copyright law\u2014in the manifold kinds of works to which they are applied and the many forms of industry in which they inhere\u2014exist almost wholly without a careful case having been laid for their existence. In light of that, the overall prescription is that intellectual property law, in general, should be sunsetted.\n\n* The economic centerpiece in the conventional wisdom justifying intellectual property law is a longstanding blunder.

Because companies exposed themselves to high statutory penalties if they ignored valid complaints, the safest path afforded by the DMCA was to remove all targeted material. Some companies did so. Some responded by developing automated triage procedures that prioritized high-risk notices for human review (most commonly, those sent by individuals).\n\n* The DMCA+ measures included the use of content filtering systems, such as YouTube\u2019s ContentID and Audible Magic. They included special takedown privileges for trusted senders; expanded profiling of users; restrictive terms of service; modifications to search functionality; and other approaches that stretched beyond the DMCA\u2019s requirements.\n\n* Smaller services sometimes ceded control of takedown to rights holder groups, in some cases via direct back-end administrative access.

Intellectual property has a functional effect on the creation, development and innovation of the intellectual products which improve our life. Software piracy is one of the important parts of the digital piracy problem, and according to Swinward et al. (1990), software was also the first copyrighted product that was duplicated on a large scale. BSA defined software piracy as the illegal copying, downloading, sharing, selling or installing of copyrighted software.\nIt is difficult to measure accurately the worldwide magnitude of the software piracy problem. According to the Business Software Alliance (BSA) Global Software Piracy Report, the rate of software piracy in 2009 was 43%. This is a serious problem for the world economy, but the problem is more serious in Turkey. According to the BSA 2009 Global Software Piracy Report, the software piracy rate in Turkey was 63% in 2009. If the assumption is made that every instance of pirated software usage equals an amount of loss in the economy, then the impact of the loss on the Turkish economy was 415 million dollars. Before advanced technology and high speed Internet, software piracy was carried out by copying disks or other types of physical objects, but now almost all types of software piracy occur over the Internet.\nThe aim of this study is to explore the factors that contribute to pirated software usage among Turkish Internet users in order to define the dynamics behind the problem of software piracy from the Internet users\u2019 perspective. Definition of the reasons behind an existing problem is a crucial part of the problem solving process. With this study the factors behind the problem of pirated software usage will be empirically analyzed from the users\u2019 perspective by applying Routine Activity Theory. According to RAT, three major factors that affect criminal activities include access to suitable targets, motivated offenders and the absence of capable guardians. According to the routine activity approach, crime or the risk of crime increases when a motivated offender identifies or encounters a suitable target in the absence of a capable guardian.", "entities": ["Turkish_language", "Intellectual_property", "Economy_of_Turkey", "BSA_(The_Software_Alliance)", "Ottoman_Empire", "World_Wide_Web", "Copyright_infringement", "Birmingham_Small_Arms_Company", "Routine_activity_theory"], "country": null, "authentic_link": "http://gradworks.umi.com/34/13/3413636.html", "citation_count": null, "literature_review": 0, "industries": null, "disciplines": null, "year": 2011.0, "label": "Analysis of the key reasons behind the pirated software usage of Turkish Internet users: Application of routine activities theory", "policies": null, "link": null}, {"collection_methods": ["Quantitative Collection Methods", "Quantitative data/text mining", "Qualitative Collection Methods", "Case study"], "data_description": "No original data.

Pace Berne, these registration mechanisms should be subjected to a more far-reaching welfare analysis. Digital technology may not only facilitate copying, but also allow the creation and maintenance of databases defining modes of exploitation and rights claimed. Some of the energies of the entertainment industry\u2019s anti-piracy campaign may be fruitfully channelled into such an enterprise. \nIt may not be realistic to expect an imminent review of the international copyright regime following the integration of key parts of Berne into the TRIPS agreement of 1994 (now administered by the WTO).

Broadly speaking, any registration requirement reduces the number of works in copyright - by how much depends on the precise structure of the system. From the patent system, we may glean that there are at least two further ways of increasing the public domain effects of registration: increasing annual fees, and claims that specify the precise nature of the rights granted.\nFrom a public policy perspective, this trade off is welcome. Protection is only granted to exploitations that are commercially valuable (and might not have occurred without protection), while future authors can make free and creative use of a larger number of cultural materials.

The last twenty years have seen rapid advancements in digital technologies and information and communication systems.

If we include even a few of these extreme examples in our calculations, it appears likely that this sample of 503 organisations could represent volumes of Orphan Works well in excess of 50 million.\n\n4)Extrapolated across UK museums and galleries, the number of Orphan Works can conservatively be estimated at 25 million, although this figure is likely to be much higher.\n\n5)The extent of Orphan Works across the public sector and their potential impact is huge. On average, 89% of participants\u2019 service delivery is at least occasionally affected, whilst 26% noted that the issue of Orphan Works either frequently affects them or affects everything that they do.\n\n6)The types of works likely to be Orphan Works are those with little commercial value, but high academic and cultural significance and where rights holders, if traced, would usually be happy for their works to be reproduced. User generated content, works by amateur or local artists and works by artists using aliases were also mentioned as at risk of being Orphan Works.\n\n7)A number of factors were identified as leading to Orphan Works, including: \n\u2212\u2212 Insufficient information identifying the copyright owner\n\u2212\u2212 The owner of the copyright could not be located\n\u2212\u2212 The copyright holder has died and there is no further information about ownership of the rights\n\n8)Overall, the most common method for managing Orphan Works is the adoption of a risk managed approach (average of 60%), whilst 4% of respondents gave \u2018other reasons\u2019. Differences in how organisations might handle Orphan Works occur between sectors.\n\n9)Organisations spent on average less than half of one day tracing rights for each Orphan Work. Therefore it would take in the region of 6 million days effort to trace the rights holders for the 13 million works represented in our on-line survey. In certain high profile projects, some organisations had spent large resources of time on chasing rights holders. However time and additional resources are also being used to educate the public and students and train (and remind) colleagues about the specifications of working with Orphan Works.\n\n10)At least 35% of organisations across all sectors, regardless of the size of their collections, do not have any specific resources in place to help deal with Orphan Works.

Without any kind of UK or European Union-wide legal certainty, there will remain a major risk for all users of Orphan Works. The quantity of Orphan Works and their impact is only accelerating as content is being created and digitised without adherence to any single internationally recognised standard for capturing provenance information.\nThe data and anecdotal feedback suggests that many public sector organisations are themselves unsure as to the extent of the problem, and that staff awareness and understanding are often limited.\n\nThere are also suggestions that often works are selected for digitisation based on the fact that they do not pose any copyright issues, thus creating a black hole of 20th century content. These issues stress the need for an informed and skilled public sector to deal with all the issues associated with copyright-related materials, the necessity for access to resources to deal with Orphan Works, and an informed and proportionate understanding of the nature of the risks associated with the use of these works.\n\nIt is crucial that policy makers recognise the problems that public sector bodies face in managing and providing public access online to a vast range of works in copyright (including Orphan Works), and create a suite of appropriate legislatively based solutions. Whether the answer is a UK or an international one, involving a change in practice and interpretation and/or a change in legislation, this is clearly a matter of urgency.

Scenario techniques open a way to conceptualise a multichannel future beyond on-line distribution. Over two axis\u2019, supply and demand constraints for a future music industry were constructed. On the demand side, the consumers will either opt for high interactivity and a large range of choice, or less interactivity and more trusted suppliers of packages. On the supply side, the options are either a centralisation of content in the form of intellectual property rights (IPRs) controlled by few players, or decentralisation with IPR creators retaining ownership.\n\n* The music industry is entering a period of instability, which is not primarily characterised by disintermediation but changing patterns of intermeditiation. The main strategic challenge to the established players appears to be that, as yet, no credible business model has emerged in the on line environment that would secure revenue streams from value-adding intermediation and, eventually, channel investments back into content production.

Revenues collected per capita vary between \u20ac0.02 (Romania) and \u20ac2.6 (France). The distribution of levy revenues to recording artists is less than \u20ac0.01 per album.\nThese variations cannot be explained by an underlying concept of economic harm to rightholders from private copying.\nThe scope of consumer permissions under the statutory exceptions for private copying within the EU vary, and generally do not match with what consumers ordinarily understand as private activities.\nIn levy countries, the costs of levies as an indirect tax are not always passed on to the consumer. In competitive markets, such as those for printers, manufacturers of levied goods appear to absorb the levy. There appears to be a pan-European retail price range for many consumer devices regardless of levy schemes (with the exception of Scandinavia).\nIn non-levy countries, such as the UK, a certain amount of private copying is already priced into  retail purchases. For example, right holders have either explicitly permitted acts of format shifting, or decided not to enforce their exclusive rights. Commercial practice will not change as a result of introducing a narrowly conceived private copying exception. \nA more widely conceived exception that would cover private activities that take place in digital networks (such as downloading for personal use, or non-commercial adaptation and distribution within networks of friends) may be best understood not as an exception but as a statutory licence.

Within the constraints of EU law, the UK\u2019s economically efficient option appears to be the de minimis argument (= no harm): a certain amount of copying in already priced into the first retail purchase. \nThe discussion of a statutory licence, or a voluntary licence under state supervision, moves beyond allocative efficiency to consumer issues (including higher norms of privacy), and the reward of creators (equity in distribution).

The author goes on to make the point that contracts between the author and publisher would exist even without copyright citing the contract between the footballer and the club as an example of that type of contract.\n* Takes a closer look into the utilitarian rationale of copyright, and suggests a shorter term copyright. \n* Secondly the author move on to contrast income of different types of creators with copyright contracts (using data from various different surveys and data sources) with income from all UK employees. The author found that the income from copyright industries was significantly less on average and far more unequal compared to income from all employment and that most artists gained large amounts of income from non-copyright sources like teaching. The author also added that artists\u2019 income was very unstable and more creators try to embark on a career than are able to sustain them.\n* Strong competition for author and lower consumer prices was suggested as a solution to motivate creators.\n* Large number of artists make their money from non-copyright works\n* Author highlights the large gap between what the top creators, in both visual and literary markets, earn compared to the rest, continues to conclude that copyright makes this gap between distributions worse. \n* Lastly the author critiqued the \u201charmony of interest assumption\u201d outlined by Landes and Posner in 1989. The author concluded that for superstar creators the market works well, they can either choose to shift risk to commercial intermediary and the publisher can also choose to share risk through a royalty contract or absorb it using a buyout. This however is not true with non-bestselling creators as they have less market power and face large amounts of competition. This conflicts with the \u201charmony of interests assumption\u201d and also empirical evidence in the paper contradict the idea that copyright provides financial independence for creators partly also due to superstar affect.", "comparative": 1, "intervention_response": "Author suggests that copyright law does not matter in the context of creators earning so could be efficient to rethink the role of copyright.", "url": "http://www.copyrightevidence.org/evidence-wiki/index.php/Kretschmer_(2012)", "type": "Study", "government_or_policy": 1, "abstract": "Copyright matters to creators. The claim has pervaded copyright jurisprudence and economic analysis for over 200 years. Creative production would not take place without the incentive of artificial scarcity that copyright law provides. Authors and artists would starve.\n\nProfessor Breyer (as he then was) wryly remarked in The Uneasy Case (1970, at 324): \u201cIt is, of course, conceivable that some prospective Miltons have given up writing after learning that Milton\u2019s daughter was destitute, but it is unlikely.\u201d\n\nThis article surveys what the empirical data actually say about the way creators live. The argument proceeds in three steps.\n\nFirst, the relationship of copyright and contract law is conceptualised, starting from an analysis of contracts concluded in a pre-copyright environment (Milton 1667; Schiller 1791). The extent of statutory dependence is then scrutinised for typical sources of earnings of creators at the beginning of the 21st century.\n\nSecond, empirical evidence on creator earnings in developed cultural markets is reviewed. It is shown that the bottom 50% of composers/songwriters earn less than 5% of the total income of the population of composers/songwriters; the bottom 50% of literary authors earn under 10% of total income; the bottom 50% of visual creators earn about 10% of total income. Median incomes are close to the poverty line. The top 10% of creators receive a disproportionally large share (visual creators: 45% of total income; literary authors: 65% of total income; composers/songwriters: 80% of total income).\n\nFinally, possible interpretations of these data in the light of Landes & Posner\u2019s \u201charmony of interest\u201d assumption (An Economic Analysis of Copyright Law, 1989) are considered and rejected.

In 2004-05, professional UK authors (defined for the purposes of this study as those who allocate more than 50% of their time to writing) earned a median (\u2018typical\u2019) wage of \u00a312,330 (=64% of the national gross median wage). In 2005, professional German authors earned a median wage of \u20ac12,000/\u00a38,280 (=42% of the national net median wage).\n\n2. Although authors\u2019 earnings are well below average, the crucial distinguishing feature is the risky nature of the profession. Writers work in winner-take-all markets. The distribution of income is highly unequal, as reflected in high Gini Coefficients: The top 10% of professional writers in the UK earn about 60% of total income (they earn at least \u00a368,200 per annum); the bottom 50% earn about 8% of total income (Gini: 0.63). In Germany, the top 10% of professional writers earn about 41% of total income (they earn at least \u20ac40,000/\u00a327,600 per annum); the bottom 50% earn about 12% of total income (Gini: 0.52). In contrast, the national Gini Coefficient for all employees in the UK is 0.33; in Germany it is 0.31.\n\n3. Compared to the UK, writers\u2019 earnings are lower and less skewed in Germany. This may reflect a more regulated environment for copyright contracts in Germany. It may also reflect the globalised nature of English language markets. In the UK sample, 7.2% of professional writers earned \u00a3100,000 or more from writing (mean=\u00a3188,062). In the German sample, just 1.7% of professional writers earned \u00a3100,000 (\u20ac145,000) or more. No German writers in the sample earned more than \u00a3345,000 (\u20ac500,000).\n\n4. Only 20% of UK writers earn all their income from writing. 60% of professional writers need another job to survive, both in Germany and the UK. However, UK and German writers show a distinct sociological profile. German authors are prepared to enter the market as a professional author (=allocating more than 50% of their time to writing) at a much lower median income than UK authors. UK authors also appear to have a more \u201cestablishment\u201d background. UK writers\u2019 households (including partners\u2019 earnings and income from non-writing jobs) earn almost double the amount of their German counterparts (UK writers\u2019 household mean: \u00a355,620; German writers\u2019 household mean: \u20ac41,644/\u00a328,734).\n\n5. Income that reflects actual use of copyright works is most skewed. For UK professional authors, the Gini Coefficient for writing income is 0.63, for total individual income of writers it is 0.51, and for total household income of writers it is 0.47. For German professional authors, the Gini Coefficient for writing income is 0.52, for total individual income it is 0.43, and for total household income it is 0.42. The distribution of income for collecting society payments (which follows actual use) is more skewed than contractual writing income (which includes risk mitigating advances). The Gini Coefficient for ALCS (UK collecting society) payments to professional writers is 0.78; for VG Wort (German collecting society) payments it is 0.67. This suggests that current copyright law may exacerbate risk.\n\n6. Writers who bargain with their publishers/producers earn about twice as much as those who don\u2019t (both in Germany and the UK). Compared to the UK, disputes over moral rights (the authors\u2019 rights to be credited where their work is used and to prevent its derogatory treatment) are double as likely in Germany, reflecting perhaps the \u201cinalienable\u201d legal status of these rights in Germany.\n\n7. Female writers earn considerably less than male writers. The greatest gap is for main-income writers (those who earn at least 50% of their income from writing): UK female main-income writers earn 59% of male average (mean) earnings; German female main-income writers earn 69.5% of male average (mean) earnings.\n\n8. Increased exploitation and use of copyright works through the Internet has not translated into increased earnings of writers. Only 14.7% of professional UK writers and 9.2% of German writers have received specific payments for Internet uses of their works. The typical earnings of authors have deteriorated since 2000, both in the UK and Germany.", "comparative": 1, "intervention_response": "For the purposes of this report, the authors have resisted drawing policy implications.

The rewards to best-selling writers are indeed high but as a profession, writing has remained resolutely unprosperous. \n\nFor less than half of the 25,000 surveyed authors in Germany and the UK, writing is the main source of income. Typical earnings of professional authors are less than half of the national median wage in Germany, and one third below the national median wage in the UK. 60% of professional writers hold a second job of some kind.\n\nThroughout the study, we have attempted to differentiate between copyright and non-copyright earnings. We also have analysed for the first time systematically the distribution of income in a creative profession, calculating the Gini Coefficient for all earnings data collected (Gini=0: every writer earns the same/perfect equality; Gini=1: one earner earns everything/perfect inequality). \n\nAfter this study, copyright policy cannot remain the same.

A general argument on the private benefits that could accrue from engaging in the creation of public goods in the form of a \u201cprivate-collective\u201d model of innovation incentives is mentioned. \n\n*New research explores how motives produce a mix of outcomes, and how various motives interact to produce contributions to open source software projects. There are new insights on how firm participation, community participation, and technical design relate to the contributors\u2019 motivations. \n\nResearch on Governance, Organization, and the Process of Innovation:\n\n*Researchers have shown interest in the challenge of governing open source software projects. Projects are based on contributions by many and sometimes thousands of volunteer developers. Volunteers can be divided into two groups: people who expect to receive rewards from contributing\nto open source software (investors), and people who do not (donators).

Case Studies and conceptual frameworks for understanding the unique character of, and the requirements for, innovation processes in open source software have been undertaken and developed.\n\nResearch on Competitive Dynamics: The Impact of Free:\n\n*Past research investigated how new technologies such as open source software can compete in an environment dominated by commercial technological standards, and a model for the impact of open source (copyleft) licensing on both the developer environment and the market for software was developed. This shows that although both commercial and open source software can coexist, scarcity of labour and product pricing must be taken into account. \n\n*Researchers also studied software firms that used open source software in delivering customized products. A framework of increasing resource allocation to open source software development showed that increased \u201cpublic\u201d investment can lead to great \u201cprivate\u201d benefits for open source\u2013oriented firms.\n\n*New research focuses on understanding competitive dynamics.

We introduce the articles in this special issue of Management Science on open source software, and show how each contributes insights to one or more of these areas.", "entities": ["Dynamical_system", "Open_source", "Software_Projects", "Management_science", "Literature_review", "Intellectual_property", "Open-source_software"], "country": null, "authentic_link": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.1060.0560", "citation_count": null, "literature_review": 0, "industries": ["Software publishing (including video games)"], "disciplines": ["Microeconomics", "Production and Organizations", "Organizational Behavior \u2022 Transaction Costs \u2022 Property Rights", "Law and Economics", "Industrial Organization", "Industry Studies: Services", "Information and Internet Services \u2022 Computer Software"], "year": 2006.0, "label": "The  Promise  of   Research  on  Open  Source  Software", "policies": ["Licensing and Business models"], "link": "http://www.idi.ntnu.no/grupper/su/courses/tdt10/curricula2010/P4-3-Krogh06.pdf"}, {"collection_methods": ["Quantitative Collection Methods", "Quantitative data/text mining"], "data_description": "Used data of copyright registrations from 1870-2006", "analysis_methods": ["Correlation and association", "Multivariate statistics", "Regression analysis"], "authors": "Ku, Sun, and Fan (2009)", "issues": ["Relationship between protection", "Relationship between creative process and protection - what motivates creators"], "entity_count": {"Special_relativity": 1, "Predictable_(Delta_Goodrem_song)": 1}, "wordcount": {"law": 4, "increasing": 1, "theory": 5, "number_of": 3, "population": 1, "test": 1, "economic": 1, "society": 1, "tested": 1, "copyright": 1, "creative_works": 2, "economy": 1, "question": 1, "morality": 1, "size": 1, "relationship_between": 1, "behave": 2, "individual": 1, "data": 1, "recognition": 1, "changes_in": 1, "our_findings": 1, "statistical_analysis": 1, "available": 1, "use": 1, "new": 1, "beyond": 1, "copyright_protection": 2, "considered": 1, "original": 1, "usually": 1, "expanded": 1, "variables": 1, "may_be": 1, "increase": 2, "doubt_on": 1, "force": 1, "U_S": 1, "this_article": 1, "subsequent": 2, "influenced": 1, "registrations": 1, "associated_with": 1, "works_created": 1, "could_be": 1, "based_upon": 1, "fits": 1, "increases": 1, "four": 1, "copyright_law": 2, "serious": 1, "copyright_registrations": 3, "expansion": 1, "behind": 1, "technology": 1, "one": 1, "overall": 1, "idea_that": 1, "created": 1, "upon": 2, "changes": 3, "neither": 1}, "plain_text_proposition": "The study examines the relationship of changes in copyright law with respect to individual categories of works, including monographs and sound recordings, and sub-categories of works, such as performing arts. \n\nIt considers all 56 congressionally created statutes and Supreme Court decisions that occurred between 1870 and 2006 together with four other concurrent variables; population, the economy, registration fees, and technological change.\n\nThe major hypothesisis that any change in copyright protection will result in changes in the number of works produced. \nThe related  minor hypotheses are that increasing copyright protection will increase the number of works produced and\u2014its corollary\u2014that decreasing copyright protection will reduce the number of works produced.\n\nFindings demonstrate that the historic long-run growth in new copyrighted works is largely a function of population.15 Sharp changes are mostly due to procedural shifts in copyright registration, such as those created by the Berne Convention Implementation Act of 1988.\n\nStatistical analysis and demonstrated that one cannot predict when a legal change will be associated with a change in copyright registrations\n\nFinally concluded with 4 ways to increase creative output.  1.

This 4-year period spans essentially the entire history of online Apache help. The Usenet log data was obtained from a World Wide Web service called Deja.com (since acquired by Google). This service archives all of the discussion groups on the World Wide Usenet and makes available advanced search and parsing capability through their website (http://groups.google.com).\n\n*The authors collected questionnaire data from people who posted either questions or answers to CIWS-U during the 4.5 months from 1 October 1999 to 15 February 2000. During this time period, they monitored activity on CIWS-U near-continuously via computer. Within 3 days of when a question or an answer was posted on CIWS-U, a computer automatically detected whether the individual was posting a question (e.g. was starting a new \u201cthread\u201d) or was providing information related to a previously posted question (e.g. was referring to an existing thread in his or her posting). It then sent a version of a questionnaire (one appropriate to information seeking or one appropriate to information providing) to the email address of that individual.

Napster is different from a VCR manufacturer because it has low-cost ways of discouraging piracy without impinging on legitimate use. That is the core insight necessary for the design of an efficient indirect liability regime.\n\nAn efficient approach to indirect liability might start by applying a negligence rule to any activity that can lead to copyright infringement. The difference is that current law focuses on knowledge, control, the extent of any noninfringing uses and other factors without being particularly clear as to why those issues are central. An explicit negligence rule would lay bare the underlying logic of the indirect liability inquiry. One drawback to the modern implicit negligence approach is that, as applied to new technologies, it can engender considerable uncertainty. A producer responsible for a new audio recording device, for example, might find it difficult to predict what courts will require in the new setting. In response, such a producer might choose to be excessively cautious.

The case study of anime fan-subbing sheds a light on the fandom\u2019s evolving dynamics. English fan-subbing of anime was triggered by the gaps in the overseas distribution of anime and, consequently, the unmet demand of US fans. Initially, it functioned within the industry structure instead of giving birth to alternatives to the authorized products.\nThe consensus of \u2018drop the project if licensed in the US (or North America)\u2019 reflected fandom\u2019s attempt to limit its effect to that of supplementing the local anime industry\u2019s offer. In addition, fan-subbing\u2019s geographical and technological constraints kept its role as a connector of missing links between the industry and viewers. However, with the arrival of digital technologies and the globalization of the fan-subbing community, fan-subbing has emerged as a new, popular model of global distribution of anime.\nThe mediation of anime text by fans is likely to lead to a surge of multiple, sometimes competing mediations of global flow of anime \u2013 by the industry as well as its consumers. Even within fansubbing itself, competing mediations are not uncommon: today we can observe multiple speed subbing groups working on the same projects, resulting in different versions of fansubs of an anime. The existence of plural mediations, within and outside the market-based system, intensifies the tension in the global mediascape by spreading multiple goals, legitimacies and operational practices of the transnational flow of cultural contents.", "comparative": 0, "intervention_response": "The anime industry exemplifies cultural industries that are facing pressure from their own consumers who, networked and coordinated on a global scale, can self-organize mediation and distribution of cultural commodities, based on the non-commercial principle. Under such pressure, the anime industry has begun framing fan-subbing as piracy. Nevertheless, the industry does not regard taking legal action as a good solution because this could alienate the fan-subbing community which has constituted the core of anime fandom. The industry\u2019s current strategy appears to be exploring a new medium \u2013 such as the internet \u2013 for global distribution of anime, but it does not look effective at reducing the demand for fan-subbing. Like DVD distribution, authorized streaming is territorially and technologically bounded and thus still cannot subdue the immediate mediation and borderless mobility of fan-subs. In this sense, we can perhaps view a significant part of the overseas anime market as a so-called missing market: in spite of overseas fans\u2019 growing demands for anime, a market hardly exists due to constraints such as high costs for global distribution, limited technologies (and thus limitations on visual quality as seen from authorized online streaming) and anime\u2019s increasing assimilation to and inclusion in the free knowledge of global anime fandom. Anime\u2019s globally dispersed missing market has been and can be explored only by the free labour of dedicated fans who have strong missions and motivations and an enthusiasm for technological innovation, and who voluntarily donate their time and skills, and can work virtually 24 hours per day collaborating with colleagues in different continents. Such a type of operation looks hard to copy and be adopted by cultural industries that work strictly within the commercial paradigm. It is yet to be observed whether or how the anime industry can come up with commercially viable models of global anime distribution that can successfully make markets out of overseas fans\u2019 desire for anime consumption.", "url": "http://www.copyrightevidence.org/evidence-wiki/index.php/Lee_(2011)_2", "type": "Study", "government_or_policy": 0, "abstract": "Recent years have seen the rise of consumers\u2019 voluntary translation and distribution of foreign cultural products on a global scale.

The research investigates two specific strategies that the recording industry has used: (1) fear or threat appeals (e.g., the threat of punishment, such as fines and/or jail time), and (2) attribution of harm (informing consumers of the harm caused by the illegal downloading of music, such as financial loss to either the artist or the recording company). The study also considers whether past illegal downloading behaviour reduces the effectiveness of these disincentive strategies. Finally, the impact of subjective norms (i.e., whether subjects think their friends would approve of downloading music) was also investigated.\n\n*Findings indicate a significant effect of threat appeal such that stronger threat appeals were found to be more effective than weaker threat appeals in reducing illegal downloading. The first study also showed that prior illegal downloading behavior does not curtail the effects of threat appeals aimed at reducing illegal downloading. In addition, results reveal no differences in downloading behavior in terms of attribution of harm deterrent strategy (harm to either the recording artist or company). The most interesting finding from the second study is that subjective norms appear to equalize low versus high past downloaders, but only under conditions of weak fear.\n\n*The current manuscript is the first to examine the impact of four different variables (threat appeals, attribution of harm, subjective norms, and previous downloadingbehavior) on subjects\u2019 likelihood to illegally download music in the future.

This ruling was made against the backdrop of widespread patent holdup where patent owners used the threat of injunctive relief to extract royalties grossly disproportionate to the value of the patented feature to the whole product. The holdup problem, however, is not equally obvious in copyright law. \n\nA close examination of the copyright cases cited in eBay reveals that they are hardly compelling authorities with respect to copyright injunction. The history of copyright law appears to suggest that injunctive relief was routinely available to copyright owners who had succeeded on the merits. More remarkably, empirical evidence shows that the majority of post-eBay decisions on copyright injunctions have totally ignored the eBay decision as well as the four-factor test advocated therein. Even among the cases that did cite eBay, most courts were reluctant to withhold injunctive relief upon a finding of copyright infringement. \n\nThis Article argues that the traditional practice of copyright law and the apparent indifference toward the eBay decision may have resulted from rational choices of judges.

This article contains a systematic study regarding copyright incentives, based on industrial statistics and extensive interviews from the music industry in China, a virtual copyright-free environment featuring one of the highest piracy rates in the world and having forced dramatic transformation of music businesses.\n\nThe empirical research indicates three seemingly paradoxical phenomena: While 17.9% of all the musicians in the sample referred to economic benefits as at least part of their motivations for music creation, 97.4% specifically recognized money as being important and helpful for music creation; While 56.4% alleged that copyright piracy did not affect their creative motivations, 72% agreed that copyright piracy does affect music creation; While 53.8% explicitly admitted that they had little awareness or knowledge of copyright, 92.3% indicated that the current level of copyright protection is insufficient and 71.8% suggested that copyright law should provide strong incentives for music creation.\n\nThe empirical evidence itself provides compelling explanations for such paradoxes: Even though musicians primarily create music for music\u2019s sake, copyright law could still supply powerful incentive for music production in a way that not only caters to market demand, but also allows for broader artistic freedom. Copyright piracy that does not necessarily affect musicians\u2019 intrinsic motivations could nevertheless affect music creation in terms of the time spent on music creation, the volume of investment in music creation, and ultimately the quality of music creation.

Rather than argue for broader copyright in terms of more or better original works, proponents have begun arguing for broader copyright on the basis of revenue and jobs. Consumer copying is theft or piracy, proponents insist, depriving copyright owners of revenue and destroying jobs. In this article, I review these arguments and show that they are empty. While the Internet and digital technology has made widespread consumer copying a reality, broader copyright can be justified only if this copying has interfered with the creation and dissemination of new original works. But it has not. Using a hand-coded data set examining the number of new artists and cover songs in the top fifty of the Billboard Hot 100 chart in the first week of each month for the years 1990-2010, I show that while music industry revenue has fallen sharply since Napster opened its virtual doors, output in the music industry, both in terms of quantity and quality, has increased just as sharply. Part of the explanation for this seemingly paradoxical result, is that the digital revolution, while it has made consumer copying trivially easily, has also reduced costs, risks, and barriers to entry in the music industry. Yet, this cannot be a complete explanation.\n\nTo account for the rest, I offer a theoretical model and a simple explanation for why the incentives for music creation have remained sufficient in the face of widespread consumer copying: Consumers don\u2019t just love music generally; they love their particular favorite artists and their specific favorite songs. While consumers would like to get music for free, they know that they have to support their favorite artists in order to get and to continue getting the music they want. As a result, self-interest tends to ensure that consumers do not free ride too much. While the resulting market is unlikely to be perfect, legislation from Congress is not likely to improve the situation. Just as product markets fail in predictable circumstances, so too do political markets.

The more covers existed the worse the quality of songs ,at that specific time period, were seen to be.\n\nThe hypothesis was that if napster caused a decrease in quality of music then  there should be more covers in the top 100 and fewer new artists.\nThe author compared pre and post napster charts and found that there was a steady decrease in the amount of covers after napster and that there was little change in new songs on the list, in fact if anything a slight increase after napster.

Rather than argue for broader copyright in terms of more or better original works, proponents have begun arguing for broader copyright on the basis of revenue and jobs. Consumer copying is theft or piracy, proponents insist, depriving copyright owners of revenue and destroying jobs. In this article, I review these arguments and show that they are empty. While the Internet and digital technology has made widespread consumer copying a reality, broader copyright can be justified only if this copying has interfered with the creation and dissemination of new original works. But it has not. Using a hand-coded data set examining the number of new artists and cover songs in the top fifty of the Billboard Hot 100 chart in the first week of each month for the years 1990-2010, I show that while music industry revenue has fallen sharply since Napster opened its virtual doors, output in the music industry, both in terms of quantity and quality, has increased just as sharply. Part of the explanation for this seemingly paradoxical result, is that the digital revolution, while it has made consumer copying trivially easily, has also reduced costs, risks, and barriers to entry in the music industry. Yet, this cannot be a complete explanation.\n\nTo account for the rest, I offer a theoretical model and a simple explanation for why the incentives for music creation have remained sufficient in the face of widespread consumer copying: Consumers don\u2019t just love music generally; they love their particular favorite artists and their specific favorite songs. While consumers would like to get music for free, they know that they have to support their favorite artists in order to get and to continue getting the music they want. As a result, self-interest tends to ensure that consumers do not free ride too much. While the resulting market is unlikely to be perfect, legislation from Congress is not likely to improve the situation. Just as product markets fail in predictable circumstances, so too do political markets. When, as in the debate over broader copyright, proposed legislation benefits a concentrated interest group, such as copyright owners, at the expense of a dispersed interest group, such as copyright consumers, Congress is systematically likely to get the answer of how much copyright is optimal wrong, and badly wrong at that.

A sample of 364 university students was used to examine each research question. Statistical results are reported.\n\nFindings \u2013 The results clearly show that downloading continues at a high rate today driven by strong belief that it is not ethically wrong. Ethical orientation was found to be positively associated with awareness of the social cost of downloading, consequences of downloading, and ethical belief in downloading. Ethical scenarios show that ethical orientation is also associated with downloading activities and with stealing. Other results indicate that respondents believe that their peers are more prone to stealing music and downloading MP3s illegally. Fear of consequences does seem to have an impact on the propensity to download illegally.\n\nPractical Implications \u2013 The paper contributes to inform industry representatives that appeal to ethic or guilt are not likely to deter illegal downloading measurably.

The Pew Internet & American Life Project\u2019s \ninterest in studying artists and musicians grew out of our previous work studying internet users\u2019 consumption of music and other creative content online. Through a series of reports on music downloading and file-sharing, we have observed and documented the changing behaviors and attitudes of an American public learning to negotiate the ever-changing copyright landscape of the digital world.\n\nHowever, over the course of observing the explosive growth and persistence of peer-to-\npeer networks, and following the entertainment industry\u2019s ongoing efforts to police these activities and promote licensed digital music services, we found that there were few sources of quantitative research directed at understanding how these issues affect both musicians and the greater creative community. We found ourselves hard-pressed to answer some of the most basic questions about artists and the internet. For instance, how many artists have access to the internet? How many promote and sell their work online? How are they using the internet to develop their work, their connections to other artists, or their connections to audiences and the \nworld-at-large? How do they feel about controversies over copyright and fair use of creative material in the heyday of peer-to-peer systems like the original Napster and the current Kazaa and BitTorrent?  \n\nThe debate about copyright in the digital era has primarily centered on the recording \nindustry\u2019s opposition to unauthorized file-sharing and downloading, a stance that has \nbeen both lauded and criticized by popular musicians. This clash over new technology \ngrows out of a long history of disputes between business and artists about the proper \nbalance between creators, the people who pay for and market creations, and consumers \nwho want access to large catalogs of digital music files and argue that there are many non-infringing uses of peer-to-peer. While music has been at the forefront of this discussion, the movie industry has also recently began suing individual downloaders. \n\nIn our surveys between 2000 and 2003, we found growing numbers of music downloaders who said they didn\u2019t care about the copyright on the files they were acquiring. Technology firms accommodated this demand by creating and marketing an ever-widening array of devices to copy and store music files. Moreover, the growth of home broadband connections has made it progressively easier to share and download \nMP3 files. The recording industry\u2019s response to this apparent apathy towards copyright and the ease of getting free files online was to file more than 7,000 lawsuits directed against alleged file-sharers since September 2003. After the first legal actions by the RIAA, the number of people who said in our surveys that they \ndownloaded music files dropped dramatically but has since rebounded to a degree.\n\nEconomic analysis of recorded music sales data and its relationship to music file-sharing activity is ongoing. At the same time, there is much to be learned from studying developments on the ground level. In the end, the future of any industry whose content can be digitized hinges on the creativity and innovation of artists.  \nBut there are strong concerns within the artistic community, and by prominent legal \nscholars, about the effectiveness of current copyright terms and their enforcement in the online world. Some argue that our understanding of copyright law has strayed far from its original purpose and that the internet calls for an inherently different interpretation of what constitutes copyright infringement and what qualifies as fair use of digitized works. Furthermore, many have raised concerns about the practical difficulties of the permissions process for creators and that too few new works are passing into the public domain. \n\nArtists are avid consumers as well as creators of online content. They often borrow from previous works and use that for inspiration for their own creativity. They represent the leading edge of media consumption online. Yet artists\u2019 perspectives and first-hand experiences with the internet \u2013 both those of musicians and the larger creative community \u2013 have rarely been examined at the national level.\n\nThere are good reasons for this apparent gap in studying artists as consumers as well as producers. They are a notoriously difficult group to define with objective measures and are often prohibitively expensive to contact in large numbers. Musicians, in particular, are often required to travel extensively, which makes them difficult to reach with traditional telephone survey methods. \n\nThe Pew Internet & American Life Project has undertaken several research initiatives to begin to probe these issues of how musicians and artists use the internet and how they feel about the copyright issues that have emerged in the digital age. There were three core research instruments for this study. The findings from these three surveys, while covering similar themes, are discussed in separate sections of the report in order to emphasize the important methodological \ndifferences between the samples. Additionally, each sample serves a different purpose, so we anticipate that some readers will appreciate having the data presented discretely in the sections that follow. \n\nThe national sample of self-identified artists allowed us to ask questions of a broad, random, and representative sample of self-identified artists from around the country, to gather baseline data on internet use by a wide range of artists in the U.S. and probe their opinions on copyright issues online.

Contrary to patent law, 55% of participants in the patent condition concluded that the later, independent inventor should be entitled to separate intellectual property rights in the second medical device.

A very successful bootleg would then go to a second pressing of another 500 copies, but this is rare. Anything in the region of 3,000 sales would be considered enormous in bootlegging circles.\n\n*Given that a release by a major label has to sell around 300,000 copies just to break even, the greatest successes of the bootleggers would still rank among the most dismal of failures for the mainstream industry.\n\n*The people who buy bootlegs are extremely committed fans who use bootlegs as a way of maintaining an ongoing, meaningful relationship with their favoured artists or bands. \n\n*The recording industry argues that bootlegs detract from officially released record sales: but the collector\u2019s interest in the unofficial recordings of an artist generally stems from an extensive knowledge of their official canon, and thus the majority of bootleg buyers will own all the official releases of their artist(s) before even beginning to buy bootlegs. \n\n*This loyalty has often been exploited by the record labels: through box sets, unreleased recordings, multiple great hits and singles collections etc. \n\n*The recording industry argues that recording artists and songwriters do not obtain any royalty payments from the sale of a bootleg: the majority of bootlegs are of live performances and these tend to involve someone smuggling a recording device into the venue and recording the show. If this is so, then the artist (and his record label) has received payment for that performance in the shape of ticket sales (not including the revenue generated from sales of concert souvenirs such as T-shirts). The artist (and her record label) have in fact received significant income from the performance that features on a bootleg.", "comparative": 0, "intervention_response": "Policy Implications:\n\n*Bootlegging could have some positive economic effects upon the official recording industry which balance out any perceived disadvantages to the industry. \n\n*The effects of piracy are complex and multifaceted, and the statistics released by the official industry do not reflect their complexity. \n\n*Research into piracy in the music industry must reflect the various forms of musical and legal meanings that individuals attach to music, and their consumption of it. Music is a commodity that requires legal protection, but the meanings given to that commodity are not merely the ones set out by those who produce it.", "url": "http://www.copyrightevidence.org/evidence-wiki/index.php/Marshall_(2004)", "type": "Study", "government_or_policy": 0, "abstract": "\\\"I don\u2019t think the record company loses one cent on a bootleg. If they go after bootleggers, they\u2019re wasting their money.\\\" (Max, a bootlegger, in Vettel, 1986)\n\nEach year, the International Federation of the Phonographic Industry (IFPI) releases a figure indicating the global value of pirated music. In 2000, this figure was $4.2 billion (IFPI, 2001). The IFPI argues that the actual losses suffered by the industry are not fully represented by this figure: \u2018The value of the pirate market does not indicate losses in revenue to the legitimate recording industry, which are likely to be far greater\u2019 (2001). These figures are then used in a strenuous lobbying campaign for the creation and enforcement of tougher copyright laws demanding, for example, restrictions on private copying exemptions, deterrent penalties and the dismantling of compulsory licensing provisions. This lobbying campaign is only likely to intensify in the future in response to online copying and the proliferation of CD burners. The IFPI, and its American equivalent, the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) are skilful and powerful lobbyists, and past evidence suggests that policy-makers will continue to be influenced by their arguments.\n\nThe effects of piracy are, however, more difficult to ascertain. This is for three reasons. First, the word \u2018piracy\u2019 is a blanket term covering a wide variety of activities, including counterfeiting, pirating, bootlegging, home taping, tape trading and online file sharing. All of these areas of piracy have individual characteristics that make any attempt at synthesis a hazardous and, some might say, misleading venture. Second, the world of illegal recordings is not the easiest from which to gather data. As Jeremy Phillips writes: \\\"Unfortunately, counterfeiters do not yet have to file annual returns to the Commission on the scale of their illegal activity, which means that the figures put forward for losses caused by counterfeiting are in danger of being subjective, hypothetical and methodologically flawed. (1999: 275)\\\"\n\nPiracy figures are often used for their rhetorical impact rather than as a reflection of reality. Thirdly, and perhaps most importantly, recording industry statistics do not take into account the variety of different meanings and uses that pirated music takes in the day-to-day lives of many people. Music plays an important role in the creation of meaning in many people\u2019s lives, and the industry\u2019s concern with questions of supply (who owns these recordings?) has neglected important questions of demand (why do people want them?) (Frith, 2002). This results in a distorted impression of the effects of piracy. For example, music industry representatives lobbying for a levy on blank audio tape in the early 1980s (and again for blank digital audio tape later in the decade) argued that every blank tape sold resulted in one less official sale (Frith, 1987: 59). The small amount of non-industry sponsored research conducted into the area, however, indicates that people often use blank tapes in non-displacing activities (for example, Brown et al., 2001; Cohen, 1990).\n\nThis article looks at one area of piracy \u2013 bootlegging \u2013 and discusses its possible effects upon the official industry. It begins by briefly differentiating bootlegging from other forms of piracy, and then provides an overview of the scale of bootlegging and the type of music fans who buy bootlegs. Following this, it discusses the possible effects of bootlegging upon the official industry. Bootlegging is a highly idiosyncratic area of piracy and the discussions here cannot necessarily be extrapolated to other spheres. However, the overall purpose of this article is to highlight the need for further research into the meanings of music piracy across a wide variety of settings in order to obtain a more realistic impression of the scale and effects of piracy in the music industry.", "entities": ["Rum-running", "Digital_Audio_Tape", "United_States", "Fred_Frith", "Recording_Industry_Association_of_America", "International_Federation_of_the_Phonographic_Industry", "Copyright_infringement", "Private_copying_levy", "Compulsory_license", "Bootleg_recording", "Tape_trading", "Jeremy_Phillips", "Compact_disc", "Counterfeit"], "country": ["United Kingdom", "United States of America"], "authentic_link": "http://mcs.sagepub.com.ezproxy.lib.gla.ac.uk/", "citation_count": 1.0, "literature_review": 0, "industries": ["Sound recording and music publishing"], "disciplines": ["Law and Economics", "Legal Procedure; the Legal System; and Illegal Behavior", "Illegal Behavior and the Enforcement of Law", "Intellectual Property and Intellectual Capital"], "year": 2004.0, "label": "The effects of piracy upon the music industry: a case study of bootlegging", "policies": ["Enforcement"], "link": "http://www.academia.edu/1935331/The_effects_of_piracy_upon_the_music_industry_A_case_study_of_bootlegging"}, {"collection_methods": ["Web analytic (online user trace data)"], "data_description": "To study the short-term effect of movie downloads on DVD sales, data on weekly DVD sales and movie torrent downloads in the USA during a 13-week period from March 2 to May 31, 2009 is used.", "analysis_methods": ["Regression analysis"], "authors": "Martikainen (2014)", "issues": ["Relationship between protection", "Relationship between creative process and protection - what motivates creators"], "entity_count": {"Torrent_file": 1, "Intellectual_property": 1, "BitTorrent": 1, "Endogeneity_(econometrics)": 1, "Autoregressive_model": 1, "Digital_copy": 1, "DVD": 1, "Mixture_model": 1, "Solid_mechanics": 1, "File_sharing": 1, "Marginal_cost": 1, "United_States": 1}, "wordcount": {"elasticity": 2, "moderate": 1, "used": 1, "effect": 2, "short_term": 2, "sales_displacement": 1, "difference": 1, "estimated": 1, "carried_out": 1, "dynamic": 1, "sales": 4, "results": 1, "different": 1, "analysis": 1, "external": 1, "period": 1, "March": 1, "data": 1, "downloads": 2, "component": 1, "newly": 1, "file_sharing": 2, "file": 1, "DVD_sales": 1, "instruments": 1, "results_suggest": 1, "panel": 1, "BitTorrent": 1, "using": 1, "setting": 1, "zero": 1, "May": 1, "controlling_for": 1, "statistically": 1, "week": 1, "time": 1, "hold": 1, "Moreover": 1, "movie": 1, "released": 1}, "plain_text_proposition": "*There are some differences between the popularity of movies on sales charts and on BitTorrent.

We found that at least 51% of students living on campus engaged in P2P, at least 42% attempted to transfer copyrighted material, and the mean number of copyrighted media titles whose transfer is attempted per week was at least 6 per monitored student.

This study also provides lessons for those who would use DPI technology to reduce illegal use of P2P.

Thus, DPI can be used to estimate the extent of piracy, and to notify individuals who may be violating copyright law. However, encryption is available and can be easily activated in most P2P clients.

While 3D printing a product may not infringe one element of IP law, it is quite possible that it will breach another type of IP. To complicate matters, the above assessment also revealed that the same branch of IP can lead to both infringement and non-infringement of protected products which are 3D printed. For example, while under s.10 of TMA 1994, it will be an infringement to print a product protected by a trade mark, s.11(2) states that if labelled correctly, infringement can be avoided\n\n* Similar to online platforms such as Napster, Grokster, Pirate Bay and Megaupload which facilitated and induced online infringement of copyright, it is quite possible that new online platforms such as Thingiverse, Shapeways, Cubify and Quirky will facilitate 3D printing of products\u2014which are protected by IP laws\u2014in time to come. However, unlike MP3 files and video copying which produced perfect copies, the same will not be true for 3D printing. \n\n* The material that will be needed to carry out 3D printing, could prove to be a challenge, but this could be an opportunity for the start-up of new businesses and business ventures specialising in raw materials which will be needed for 3D printing.

The drawback of this model is the risk of creating a monopoly. The entertainment industry welcomed Apple\u2019s iTunes business model when it was launched and was in fact reluctant to license to anyone else. Now, with Apple having the upper hand or the monopoly, the entertainment industry is in constant negotiation with Apple regarding their pricing strategy. The stakeholder most likely to lose out from such negotiations is the artist. In the present context, it could be the manufacturer who could be losing out.

Few Respondents reported cases in which they were unable to secure licenses.  Two Respondents reported that their organizations had approached firms that held exclusive NIH licenses on, in one case, a potentially blocking patent, and in another, a desirable technology, and in each case licenses were outright refused.  In the latter case, the PDPPP was able to invent around the technology.  A third Respondent reported that a company had refused to grant a license for an \u201cenabling technology\u201d even though it was for a different field of use, and the PDPPP was able to use other technologies to fill the gap.  A fourth Respondent related a case in which a vaccine was exclusively licensed by the NIH with worldwide rights to a large pharmaceutical firm, which had no intention to market in the developing world; the NIH was heavily \u2013 and successfully -- lobbied to get them to alter their licensing strategy in subsequent technology transfer agreements.\n\n*Overall, most Respondents did not perceive IP issues to be insurmountable, but they clearly are requiring substantial efforts in time and money to manage.

However, the inputs here were the reasons for downloading rather than buying a physical version, and the reasons for streaming or accessing content. \n* A four- and a three-factor solution were chosen, again, on the basis of Eigen values and factor comprehension. \n* A two-stage cluster analysis was used to create the cluster seeds while the final cluster solution was created using a K-means cluster analysis. \n*A four-cluster solution was chosen on the basis of cluster membership homogeneity, and cluster heterogeneity, as well as cluster comprehension. \n* A count variable was created on respondent level data for the number of content types for which the individual consumed infringed content, using the derived illegal file calculation outline in section 3.2: \n*This was repeated for 100% illegal consumption over the different content types. \n* The attitudes and behaviours of the different platform groups were then further analysed.", "analysis_methods": ["Quantitative Analysis Methods", "Descriptive statistics (counting; means reporting; cross-tabulation)"], "authors": "Ofcom-Kantar (2013)", "issues": ["Understanding consumption/use"], "entity_count": {"Copyright_infringement": 1, "Database": 1, "Spend_analysis": 1, "Ofcom": 1, "Digital_Economy_Act_2010": 1, "Contract": 1, "Decile": 1, "Cluster_analysis": 1, "Software": 1, "Great_Britain": 1, "Hargreaves_Review_of_Intellectual_Property_and_Growth": 1, "K-means_clustering": 1, "Manfred_Eigen": 1, "Force": 1}, "wordcount": {"overview": 1, "making": 1, "categories": 1, "generate": 1, "material": 2, "detail": 2, "copyright": 1, "establishing": 1, "adoption": 1, "among": 2, "market": 1, "interest": 2, "period": 1, "document": 1, "data": 3, "In": 1, "trends": 2, "methodologies": 1, "Research": 1, "Ofcom": 2, "consumption": 2, "using": 2, "Hargreaves_Review": 1, "designed_to": 1, "provided": 1, "according_to": 2, "attitudes": 1, "also": 1, "to_gather": 1, "behaviour": 4, "research": 5, "sample": 2, "behavioural": 4, "copyright_infringement": 1, "volume": 4, "commissioned": 1, "technical": 1, "infringement": 4, "aged": 1, "following": 1, "internet": 1, "base": 1, "online": 5, "this_study": 1, "relating_to": 2, "general": 3, "was_conducted": 1, "assist": 1, "illegal": 2, "including": 1, "October": 1, "could_be": 1, "amongst": 1, "end": 1, "programmes": 1, "main": 2, "illegally": 1, "Intellectual_Property": 1, "based_on": 3, "films": 1, "across": 2, "groups": 2, "objectives": 1, "video_games": 1, "concentrated": 1, "types": 5, "The": 2, "full": 1, "achieved": 1, "motivations_for": 2, "we_conducted": 1, "number_of": 1, "in_order": 1, "survey": 1, "total": 1, "initial": 1, "substantial": 1, "first": 1, "across_all": 1, "Digital": 1, "key_findings": 1, "key": 2, "undertaken": 3, "allows": 1, "stakeholders": 1, "objective": 1, "analysis": 9, "relationship_between": 2, "covering": 1, "infringing": 4, "i_e": 1, "followed": 1, "high": 1, "greater": 1, "segmentation": 3, "reports": 1, "used": 3, "Economy": 1, "statistical_analysis": 1, "details": 2, "consumers": 3, "non": 1, "six": 2, "May": 1, "this_report": 1, "understanding": 2, "progress": 1, "computer_software": 1, "motivations": 1, "Government": 1, "insight_into": 1, "particular": 1, "attitudes_towards": 1, "adults": 1, "people": 1, "primary": 1, "found": 2, "target": 1, "multiple": 2, "early": 1, "type": 1, "policy": 1, "a_simple": 1, "books": 1, "two": 1, "specific": 1, "aim": 1, "collected": 1, "reporting": 1, "mixed": 1, "employed": 1, "content": 11, "offline": 1, "top": 1, "help": 1, "TV": 1, "music": 1, "UK": 1, "examine": 2, "complex": 2, "streams": 1, "related": 2, "infringers": 9, "access": 1, "allow": 1, "Act": 1, "copyright_enforcement": 1, "proportion": 1, "made": 1, "per": 1, "robust": 1, "effectively": 1, "to_assess": 1, "track": 1}, "plain_text_proposition": "Key findings\n\nWe conducted a series of in-depth analyses using the combined data sets from the first two waves of the Online Copyright Infringement tracking study. The purpose was to examine in more detail the complex relationship between general consumption, infringement, attitudes, and spend across six key content types. The work revealed the following:\n\n\nDecile analysis: A more detailed look at the Top 20% Infringers\n\nInfringers were segmented into 10% groups according to the overall volume of content they indicated they had accessed illegally. The main findings were as follows:\n\n* The Top 10% Infringers accounted for just 1.6% of the 12+ internet user population, but were responsible for 79% of infringed content. The Top 20% infringers, accounting for 3.2% of 12+ internet users, were responsible for 88% of infringements.\n* Infringers were more male, 16-34 and ABC1 than the general internet population. However, the Top 20% Infringers were even more likely to be male and 16-34 than the Bottom 80%. (We used the Top 20% Infringers rather than the Top 10% Infringers as the larger sample size makes comparisons more robust).\n* Despite their high levels of infringement, the Top 20% Infringers also accounted for 11% of the legal content consumed.\n* The Top 20% Infringers also spent significantly more across all content types on average than either the Bottom 80% Infringers or the non-infringing consumers (\u00a3168 vs. \u00a3105 vs. \u00a354 over the six month period covered).\n\n\nInfringing segments\n\nAs well as segmenting by volume of content infringed, we also segmented infringers by their reasons for doing it. This resulted in four distinct infringing groups:\n\n1. Justifying Infringers (9% of infringers, 24% of infringed volume, 2% of total digital consumers):\n\nThis group had the highest levels of infringement. They felt they had spent enough on content already, and this sentiment was confirmed by their high total spend offline. Most of their digital consumption was streamed and primarily related to music, though they also consumed the highest proportion of illegal books across the segments. Generally, they like to try before they buy (related to their willingness to spend) and appear to be the most receptive to good/well-priced legal alternatives.\n\n2. Digital Transgressors (9% of infringers, 22% of infringed volume, 2% of total digital consumers):\n\nThis was the youngest infringing group, with the majority in education. They had the highest levels of downloading behaviour and had higher consumption of films and TV programmes than the other high infringing group (Justifying Infringers). This group showed the least remorse about infringing material, but also had the highest fear of getting caught. In fact, they appeared to be the most receptive to receiving letters from ISPs alleging infringement.  \n\n3. Free Infringers (42% of infringers, 35% of infringed volume, 10% of total digital consumers):\n\nThis was the largest group and was chiefly defined by the fact they infringed because it was free. They paid for a low proportion of the content they consumed and had the lowest total content spend among the infringing segments. They were responsible for the high majority of illegal consumption of video games and computer software.\n\n4. Ambiguous Infringers (39% of infringers, 20% of infringed volume, 9% of total digital consumers):\n\nThis group had the lowest levels of digital consumption and the highest proportion of paid and legal content. They generally offered fewer justifications for infringing and for stopping infringing. This appeared to be linked to their lower levels of infringing activity and a lack of confidence in knowing what is legal.\n\n* Infringers generally consumed more paid and legal content than the non-infringing segments, although this formed a lower proportion of their total consumption than it did for non-infringers.\n* Most infringing segments found it easy to find content on the internet for free which would normally be paid, ranging from 45% for the Ambiguous Infringers to 76% for the Top 20% infringers. Among non-infringers the figures were notably lower, ranging from 28% to 45%.\n\n\nNon-infringing segments\n\nAs well as segmenting the infringers, we also segmented consumers who downloaded or streamed legal content only. The four groups are summarised as follows:\n\n1. Simple Streamers (34% of legal consumers, 27% of total digital consumers):\n\nThis group was primarily defined by the fact that they only streamed content and didn\u2019t download any. This content largely comprised TV programmes and music and was generally accessed for entertainment and convenience purposes.\n\n2. Simple Downloaders (17% of legal consumers , 13% of total digital consumers):\n\nThey were defined by the fact that they only downloaded and didn\u2019t stream. They consumed less content than the other non-infringing segments, and largely downloaded books and music. Despite this, relatively they had the largest proportion of paid-for content.\n\n3. Paying Consumers (34% of legal consumers, 27% of total digital consumers):\n\nThis group paid for the majority of the content that they consumed, while also spending a lot on offline (such as physical) content.\n\n4. Free Opportunists (14% of legal consumers, 11% of total digital consumers):\n\n100% of this group claimed to download because it is free. They consumed a higher volume of free content than any of the other non-infringing segments.\n\n\nInfringement of multiple content types\n\nWe also analysed behaviour according to the number of types of content that were infringed.\n\n* Most people (62%) contained their infringement to only one content type of the six measured in the study, and this was predominantly music (42%) or films (28%).\n* Where there was infringement in more than one content type it generally included combinations of music, films and TV programmes. Infringement of computer software and video games was more prevalent among those that had infringed across four or more content types.\n* Those that infringed across multiple content types also infringed a higher volume of content on average.\n* Category spend was highest for those that infringed in three content types. \n\n\nSpend analysis among infringers\n\nFurther analysis was undertaken to assess the complex relationship between infringement and spend on content, and to assess the revenue potential if infringement could be converted to legal consumption:\n\n* Generally, the data from the survey showed that as people consumed more infringed files they also consumed more legal files, and spent more on legal content.\n* Further assessment on price-sensitivity for music showed that the optimum price infringers were willing to pay (either for single downloadable tracks, or for particular premium subscriptions) generally increased as the volume of infringed content increased. (Although the optimum subscription price was below that currently charged for the first premium tier of a number of UK music streaming services, many also offer free versions, albeit with some service restrictions or limitations).\n* This optimum music price was mapped alongside banded illegal consumption in order to estimate potential additional monthly spend (lost revenue) if all infringed content was paid for at this price.\n* The data suggest that improvements to legal alternatives could potentially convert some music infringers to pay for their content (either by track or monthly) if the price was right. However, the relationship between infringement and spend is complex and the claims people make when asked questions about their likely future behaviour given changes to their options do not always closely reflect their real-life behaviour.", "comparative": 1, "intervention_response": "Interesting policy implications can be derived by the following findings:\n\n* Top 10% of infringers are responsible for almost 80% of the infringed content.\n\n* The main types of infringers are the following: justifying infringers, digital transgressors, free infringers and ambiguous infringers.\n\n* Those who do not infringe can be characterised as: simple streamers, simple downloaders, paying consumers and free opportunists.\n\n* Most of the infringement occurs in the following two industries: music and films.", "url": "http://www.copyrightevidence.org/evidence-wiki/index.php/Ofcom-Kantar_(2013)", "type": "Study", "government_or_policy": 1, "abstract": "Research overview \n\nBackground and objectives \n\nIn early 2012 Ofcom commissioned research designed to track consumers\u2019 behaviour and attitudes towards both lawful and unlawful access of copyright material using the internet, relating to six content types; music, films, TV programmes, computer software, books and video games. The primary objective of this research was to gather data and generate insight by establishing initial benchmarks and trends that could be used to assist policy making related to online copyright enforcement. This followed the adoption by Government of a recommendation made in the Hargreaves Review of Intellectual Property and Growth that Ofcom should not wait until its progress-reporting duties under the Digital Economy Act came into force to begin gathering trends and benchmarks related to consumption of content online.\n\nThe research universe for this study was all adults aged 12+ in the UK. The survey used a mixed methodology approach whereby data was collected using both an online and offline sample. All material relating to the main tracking study, including key findings and full technical details, can be found at:\n \nhttp://stakeholders.ofcom.org.uk/market-data-research/other/telecoms-research/copyright-infringement-tracker/ \n\nThe total sample achieved from the first two waves of the tracking study (covering the period May- October 2012) was 10,594, and this provided a robust and substantial base for the further statistical analysis in this report. The main aim of this analysis was to examine in more detail the complex relationship between general consumption, infringement, attitudes, and spend across six key content types of interest. There was a particular interest in understanding content infringers in more detail. The following streams of \u2018deep dive\u2019 analysis were undertaken:\n\n1. Decile behavioural analysis among infringers \n\nThis analysis segmented infringers into bands of 10% based on volume of content consumed illegally. This allows insight into the proportion of illegal content for which each decile of infringers is responsible. It is effectively a simple \u2018behavioural\u2019 segmentation based on the volume of infringement. In-depth profiling of the highest infringing decile groups (the top 20%) was then undertaken to allow greater understanding of high-volume infringers. \n\n2. Attitudinal segmentations amongst infringers and non-infringers \n\nIn addition to the decile behavioural analysis which segmented infringers on volume of illegal content consumed, we conducted an \u2018attitudinal\u2019 segmentation. The key inputs for this segmentation were motivations for infringing. Non-infringing consumers were also segmented separately according to their motivations for general online behaviour. Both the behavioural and the attitudinal segmentations can be used to help target groups of consumers based on their motivations. \n\n3. Infringement of multiple content types \n\nThe reports for the tracking study concentrated on general online behaviour and infringement per content type, and across all types. This extra layer of analysis was conducted in order to examine behaviour according to the number of types of content that were infringed i.e. are people actively infringing across multiple categories, and in what category combinations? \n\n4. Spend analysis among infringers \n\nAdditional analysis was undertaken to assess the complex relationship between infringement and spend on content. \nFurther details of the specific analysis methodologies employed can be found in the Technical Appendix at the end of this document.", "entities": ["Cluster_analysis", "Force", "Hargreaves_Review_of_Intellectual_Property_and_Growth", "Database", "Manfred_Eigen", "Great_Britain", "Digital_Economy_Act_2010", "Spend_analysis", "Copyright_infringement", "K-means_clustering", "Ofcom", "Contract", "Decile", "Software"], "country": ["United Kingdom"], "authentic_link": "http://stakeholders.ofcom.org.uk/binaries/research/telecoms-research/online-copyright/deep-dive.pdf", "citation_count": null, "literature_review": 0, "industries": ["Sound recording and music publishing", "Film and motion pictures", "Television programmes", "Software publishing (including video games)", "Publishing of books, periodicals and other publishing"], "disciplines": ["General", "Law and Economics", "Intellectual Property and Intellectual Capital"], "year": 2013.0, "label": "OCI Tracker Benchmark Study.

Intellectual property law has never protected comedians effectively against theft. Initially, jokes were virtually in the public domain, and comedians invested little in creating new ones. In the last half century, however, comedians have developed a system of IP norms. This system serves as a stand-in for formal law. It regulates issues such as authorship, ownership, transfer of rights, exceptions to informal ownership claims and the imposition of sanctions on norms violators. Under the norms system, the level of investment in original material has increased substantially. We detail these norms, which often diverge from copyright law's defaults. Our description is based on interviews with comedians, snippets of which we include throughout the paper. \n\nOur study has implications for intellectual property theory and policy. First, its suggests that the lack of legal protection for intellectual labor does not entail a market failure by necessity, as social norms may induce creativity. Second, it suggests that the rules governing a particular creative practice affect not only how much material is created, but also its kind. Third, we suggest that comedians' IP norms system emerged over the past half century as technological change increased the benefit of having property rights in jokes and concomitantly reduced the costs of enforcing those rights. Fourth, we note that stand-up's norms system recognizes only a limited set of forms of ownership and transfer. We suggest that the system's crude rights structure is driven by the fact that effective enforcement requires that ownership be clear to the community. Lastly, social norms offer a way to regulate creative practices that do not sit well within IP law's one-size-fits-all mold. They do so, moreover, without imposing on society the costs of disuniformity in the formal law, including legal complexity and industry-driven lobbying. \n\nStand-up's norms system has both benefits and costs, which we detail in the paper. However, norms-based IP systems offer an alternative (or supplementary) cost/benefit bundle which in some cases may be superior to that of formal law alone. In stand-up's case, norms economize on enforcement costs and appear to maintain a healthy level of incentives to create alongside a greater diversity in the kinds of humor produced. A final assessment of stand-up's social norms system awaits further work.

We first consider a model with unit demand and full participation so that any increase in revenues stems from higher prices. The property that sampling allows consumers to find a better match to their tastes, tends to lead to higher profits under file-sharing. However, there is a countervailing effect: consumers have the option to download and listen to music without paying for it. In other words, consumers have the option to simply keep the download but not to buy the song or album. This tends to make not buying a more attractive option and tends to reduce the willingness-to-pay for music. We show that the former effect dominates the latter and that the introduction of file-sharing technologies leads to higher profits if there is\nsufficient taste heterogeneity and sufficient product diversity.

It is rarely used as a compliment. It is rather used as an epithetic description intended to have broad explanatory power for nearly any of the many and glaring limitations that speakers and commentators contend exist in the court\u2019s body of law. The empirical basis for the argument comes from a single finding: that between 1996 and 2000 the Second and Ninth Circuit Courts of Appeals referenced legal scholarship in their decisions in trademark and copyright cases nearly four times as often as the Federal Circuit referenced legal scholarship in its decisions in patent cases. While scholars and others have relied upon this finding to assert that the Federal Circuit\u2019s performance is intellectually deficient, there are reasons to question whether that inference is proper. For instance, it stands in contrast to other observations that suggest the Federal Circuit behaves a lot like the regional circuits when it comes to its relationship to legal scholarship. \n\nIn this study, we explore the U.S. Supreme Court\u2019s use of legal scholarship in its patent, trademark, and copyright jurisprudence. We report evidence of striking differences in the use of scholarship that depend on whether a decision concerns patent, trademark, or copyright law. The Court uses scholarship in patent decisions at a rate of 28%, but uses it around twice as often in its copyright (67%) and trademark (53%) decisions. While, moreover, the rates at which the Court uses legal scholarship in its copyright and trademark decisions are some of the highest observed in the Court\u2019s entire jurisprudence, the rate at which the Court uses legal scholarship in its patent decisions is among the lowest observed.

In more differentiated analyses, we find that only movies that were on wide release in a relatively large number of theaters (blockbusters) benefited from the unavailability of Megaupload, while the effect on more narrowly released movies was neutral and even negative for niche movies. We subject these results to a number of robustness checks to rule out alternative explanations using different specifications and additional data.\nA mechanism that can explain these prima facie counterintuitive findings is that piracy generates positive externalities through information about the quality of an experience good spilling over from pirates to (potential) legal consumers. Once it becomes significantly less easy to consume pirated content online, as was the case in our empirical setting, we would expect that at least some consumers revert to legal consumption, increasing movie revenues. At the same time, the positive externalities from pirates to legal consumers vanish, so that a number of prospective legal consumers (who would pay for watching the movie) end up being less informed about specific titles, which reduces their likelihood of going to the movies. The net effect on a specific movie\u2019s revenues then depends on how important the information externality is for the performance of this movie.

In broader terms, P2P exchanges are a form of what has occasionally been labeled \u201cconsumer-to-consumer\u201d (C2C) exchange. What little work there is in business research which has examined both C2C and P2P exchange has to-date been largely anecdotal or conceptual. This paper aims to address these shortcomings.\nDesign/methodology/approach \u2013 A model of antecedents germane to the P2P phenomenon is formulated and empirically tested which includes the consumer\u2019s satisfaction with, extent of usage of, and future behavioral intentions toward P2P exchanges as the focal endogenous constructs of interest.\nFindings \u2013 The model is tested with perceptual and archival data from a survey of consumers active in one prevalent form of P2P exchange (i.e. the \u201cswapping\u201d of pirated music). The model explains significant variance in all three focal endogenous constructs.\nResearch limitations/implications \u2013 The primary limitations include the study\u2019s exploratory nature and not being able to incorporate all potentially salient constructs and variables germane to the P2P phenomenon within the context of the study reported here. Additionally, and from a sampling perspective, a more heterogeneous sample may benefit future research.\nPractical implications \u2013 The key insight emerging from the work is that the wide prevalence of P2P exchanges occurring globally between consumers has more to do with unexplored aspects of the phenomenon (such as its convenience; the \u201cconnectedness\u201d it makes consumers feel to others) and seemingly much less to do with traditional marketing mix variables.\nOriginality/value \u2013 While much has been written in the practitioner ranks and popular press about the problem of P2P exchanges, this work represents one of the first empirical studies of the antecedent drivers of the phenomenon. As is articulated in the paper\u2019s concluding sections, from a more embracing frame of reference, P2P systems and \u201cconsumer-to-consumer\u201d exchanges are not the dire threats many marketing managers believe them to be.

Hence the work-rate of a Digitisation facility at the start of a 10-year project is significantly lower than towards the end. This is not only due to the increased technical competence of the people involved, but also the gradual refinement and streamlining of workflow over the period of the project. This effect has been noted even in 3-year projects, with a significant majority of the Digitisation completed during the project lifetime being completed in the 3rd year.\n\n* Due to natural market forces and the increasing presence of low-cost, high-volume Digitisation services in India and the Far East, the unit cost of Digitisation provided by 3rd party services has decreased significantly over the past 10 years.\n\n* The Return on Investment in large-scale Digitisation tends to be higher where there is ongoing strategic investment in Digitisation as a core activity of the cultural institution, rather than as a project-funded activity.

These rights include the right to copy, adapt, publish, communicate to the public and publicly perform the copyright material.  To balance the rights of copyright owners with the needs of the general public, the Copyright Act provides a number of exceptions to the general rules regarding infringement of copyright. The appropriate role and scope of these exceptions has been an ongoing matter for debate, particularly with the advent of digital copying (see ALRC 2013).\n\nConsistent with an emerging interest in better understanding the size and economic contribution of those industries which rely, to varying degrees, on copyright law, this study uses the global framework (WIPO 2003) to document the economic contribution of Australia\u2019s copyright industries over time. Due to data classification variations, the results presented in this report differ somewhat from previous estimates.\n\nThis is the fourth copyright industries economic contribution study supported by the Australian Copyright Council (see Allen Consulting Group 2001, PwC 2008, PwC 2012).  It is important to appreciate that while the focus of this report is on the economic activity reliant to some degree on the institutional support provided by copyright law, there are a range of cultural, social and other benefits associated with the creation of copyright protected material that are not necessarily captured in the reported figures. That is, elements of copyright material - such as arts, which are seen as an important part of Australian lives - may generate benefits (e.g. cultural) that are not necessarily reflected in the market value for the goods or services (Towse 2000, p 115) ;(Australia Council 2014, p 10).\n\nIn compiling this report it is difficult to not consider the forces that have emerged to shape Australia\u2019s copyright industries in recent years:\n#Over the period considered in this study the demand for Australia\u2019s natural resources, principally to support the rapid growth of China, has meant that the Australian Dollar has been above its historic average value. As a consequence, imports have become cheaper, to the point that we have seen deflation across a range of imported products, and a continued decline in Australia\u2019s copyright industry manufacturing base.\n#Many copyright products (e.g. music, movies, games, software, books, newspapers, etc) are continuing to move from physical distribution to electronic distribution, enabling the disintermediation of the supply chain (e.g. lessening the need for a physical retail presence) as consumers have shifted their consumption to digital versions and online delivery\n#There has been an increased risk of unauthorised copying because of the low cost of reproduction of perfect digital copies. Indeed the value of the production of unauthorised copyright products is not included even though they should possibly be considered part of the copyright industries.\n\nIn this changing and challenging environment there is a continued need for copyright industries to develop, supported by copyright law, which provides certainty and the incentive to innovate and grow.", "entities": ["Australia", "Australia_national_rugby_union_team", "Deflation", "Supply_chain", "Energy_policy_of_China", "PricewaterhouseCoopers", "Disintermediation", "Copyright_law_of_Australia", "Australian_Copyright_Council", "World_Intellectual_Property_Organization", "Australian_dollar", "Australia_Council_for_the_Arts"], "country": ["Australia"], "authentic_link": "http://www.copyright.org.au/acc_prod/ACC/Research_Papers/The_Economic_Contribution_of_Australia_s_Copyright_Industries_2002-2014.aspx", "citation_count": 1.0, "literature_review": 0, "industries": ["Publishing of books, periodicals and other publishing", "Software publishing (including video games)", "Film and motion pictures", "Television programmes", "Sound recording and music publishing"], "disciplines": ["Entertainment \u2022 Media", "Intellectual Property and Intellectual Capital", "Government Policy"], "year": 2015.0, "label": "The Economic Contribution of Australia's Copyright Industries 2002-2014", "policies": ["Nature and Scope of exclusive rights"], "link": "http://www.copyright.org.au/acc_prod/ACC/Research_Papers/The_Economic_Contribution_of_Australia_s_Copyright_Industries_2002-2014.aspx"}, {"collection_methods": ["Quantitative Collection Methods", "Quantitative data/text mining", "Qualitative Collection Methods", "Case study", "Semi-structured interview", "Qualitative content/text mining"], "data_description": "This study uses World Bank economic data combined with Consumers International rankings, collected for research conducted by Lateral Economics, the Standing Committee of Legal and Constitutional Affairs, and PricewaterhouseCoopers.

The ALRC\u2019s recommendation in favour of fair use is based predominantly on a legal analysis and did not include an economic cost-benefit analysis (CBA).

And with most on-line collections, web visitors are able to see the items while using enhanced searching and browsing capabilities to find them. This capability expands the usability of the on-line collections in ways traditional finding aids and box lists cannot match. There is a wealth of interesting and helpful material in most libraries - and as long as items are truly historic (19th Century and before) and without literary or copyright claims, the process of creating online collections is straightforward. Find the items, scan them, provide access: more primary resources on the web (though the process is a little more complicated than that). Creating an online resource for more recent historical documents (i.e., created or published less than 78 years ago) adds another large layer of difficulty to the task.\nThe Digital Scriptorium at Duke University creates on-line projects for a variety of collections, ranging from ancient papyri to 20th-Century photography. For the most part, everything that has been made available by the Scriptorium has either been out of copyright or, in the case of the photos, the library owns the copyright to the items themselves. \nThe Ad*Access project, however, presented an entirely new challenge. Ad*Access, an on-line database, gives researchers around the world images and information for more than 7,000 advertisements printed primarily in U.S. newspapers and magazines between 1911 and 1955. It is the collaborative effort of the Digital Scriptorium and the John W. Hartman Center for Sales, Advertising & Marketing History. Generously supported by the Duke Endowment \\\"Library 2000\\\" Fund, Ad*Access was created using materials in the J. Walter Thompson Company Competitive Advertisements Collection. \nThe vast majority of the advertisements chosen for this project were created and published after 1923. Clearly beyond the copyright-free zone, the library had to answer the question of whether the pursuit of copyright permission was necessary, as the project was created by an educational institution for research and study. In other words, did the project fall within fair use? \nThis article describes how that decision was made and the implications of that decision.

As a partial result,it can be noted that distinct differences exist in the care invested in choosing download material between those users who have no costs whatsoever for a download,and those who have to pay.This result indicates that under real conditions,not all files which are downloaded illegally from the internet would be saleable.Therefore,on no account can the number of illegally-acquired files be treated as commensurate with music industry losses.The reason why there are no significant differences between those groups with different payment conditions lies,among other things,in the experimental design,which had to allow for restrictions to the duration of the simulation period and the consistent budget of \u20ac75.Certainly,studies over a longer period of time with variable budgets would yield more vivid results.\n\n* Differences between the groups can provide clues as to the effect of economic incentives on users\u2019willingness to cooperate in an anticipatory manner.While downloads from the commercial provider do not lead to financial gains for any participating user,the users in groups 25:75, 50:50 and 75:25 profited from downloads by other users.Therefore,the tests on group differences can be looked upon as rough partial tests of the distribution revenue model.\n\n* Looking at the users\u2019interactions,there are several indications that social norms are at work:a closer inspection of the log file data reveals that almost all users in the revenue-sharing conditions began the simulation period by immediately buying songs from the commercial provider,i.e.they spent (virtual) money in order to establish a common basis for further exchange.After a very short period of time (about three minutes in each condition) they began to download songs from other participants without being addressed by them first.It can be assumed that they did so because they believed that other users would download from their account in the future.", "comparative": 0, "intervention_response": "* .This study confirms that users \u2013 at least under experimental conditions \u2013 show a willingness to cooperate and take future profits of their own into account.The strategy observed in the experiment more or less resembles the cooperation part of the \u2018tit for tat\u2019strategy well known from game theory (Axelrod,1990).In the long run,all users benefit from a cooperative strategy,as they would miss out on financial benefits if they did not cooperate.Therefore,a cooperative strategy can be regarded as the most effective choice economically.Moreover,these systems could be interesting for users who want to make a profit by building up an extensive database in order to resell their files.\n\n* According to the authors, the explorative study has severe limitations and only parts of the theoretical ideas discussed above are covered by the data.It was unable to investigate a number of factors that also might have a decisive impact on user behaviour. Further experimental research might consider factors such as unlimited time,a larger number of participants,the integration of chatrooms,new ways of distribution (including cellphones and personal digital assistants (PDAs)),real budgets and real songs.While the participants more or less behaved according to the theoretical idea in a 30-minute simulation period,long-term online experiments might clarify whether or not some users drop out of the system because they are never addressed, while other users emerge as new big players within the system. In this context it would be interesting to see how other users\u2019attitudes towards new big players develop.", "url": "http://www.copyrightevidence.org/evidence-wiki/index.php/Quiring,_Von_Walter_and_Atterer_(2008)", "type": "Study", "government_or_policy": 0, "abstract": "Illegal filesharing on the internet leads to considerable financial losses for artists and copyright owners as well as producers and sellers of music.

Thus, at the outset of the negotiations that led to  the formation of the Berne Convention in 1884, the distinguished Swiss delegate Numa Droz  stated that it should be remembered that \u201climits to absolute protection are rightly set by the  public interest.\u201d2  In consequence, from the original Berne Act of 1886,3 the Berne  Convention has contained provisions granting latitude to member states to limit the rights of  authors in certain circumstances.  In keeping with this approach, the present international  conventions on authors\u2019 and related rights contain a mixture of limitations and exceptions on  protection that may be adopted under national laws.  These can be grouped, very roughly,  under the following headings:\n\n1.  Provisions that exclude, or allow for the exclusion of, protection for particular  categories of works or material.  \n\n2. Provisions that allow for the giving of immunity (usually on a permissive, rather than  mandatory, basis) from infringement proceedings for particular kinds of use, for example,  where this is for the purposes of news reporting or education, or where particular conditions  are satisfied. \n\n3. By provisions that allow a particular use of copyright material, subject to the payment  of compensation to the copyright owner. \n\nThe juridical and policy basis for each kind of provision is different.  The first proceeds  on the assumption that there are clear public policy grounds that copyright protection should  not exist in the works in question, for example, because of the importance of the need for  ready availability of such works from the point of view of the general public.  The second  represents a more limited concession that certain kinds of uses of works that are otherwise  protected should be allowed:  there is a public interest present here that justifies overriding the  private rights of authors in their works in these particular circumstances.

Figure 3.2 displays the distribution of video game introductions per platform and the ratio of new IP introductions by platform maturity. The figure illustrates that, across different levels of platform maturity, there is sufficient variance in terms of the number of games entering each platform as well as the ratio of video games that are based on new intellectual property.\n\n* There exists a concave curvilinear effect of platform maturity on complement sales. As the number of late platform adopters increases, the positive effect of indirect network effects is mitigated by differences in late adopters\u2019 characteristics and behavior. Moreover, these differences do not affect all types of complements equally. First, late adopters increasingly shy away from choosing innovative complements in favor of non-novel ones. Platform maturity thus amplifies the sales disparity between innovative and non-novel complements. Secondly, late adopters increasingly congregate around superstar complements amplifying the skewness between popular and less popular complements on the platform. \n\n* Two auxiliary findings are that there exist positive indirect network effects and negative same side network effects in the market for console video games. An additional game entering the platform has a negative effect on cumulative unit sales for games launched in the subsequent month. The latter result adds support to the \u201ccompetitive crowding\u201d hypothesis of direct network effects for complements in platform markets (Boudreau, 2012; Wareham et al., 2014). The finding is consistent with Venkatraman and Lee (2004) who conclude that video game developers are less likely to enter crowded video game platforms.

Its success has revealed a community of hackers that have attempted to circumvent the exclusive arrangement that Apple shares with AT&T for cellular telephone service. Unfortunately for Apple (and similarly situated manufacturers), intellectual property doctrines and laws do not prevent consumers from altering their products so as to circumvent relationships that manufacturers may have with others. Manufacturers inevitably lose capacity to control the product as a result of the sale of specific units. The doctrines of first sale in both patent and copyright law prevent manufacturers from controlling consumer manipulation of the object after the sale has been completed. Additionally, the Digital Millennium Copyright Act's anti-circumvention provision does not necessarily apply to prevent consumers from altering firmware within a product. Manufacturers are increasingly turning to alternatives to intellectual property to secure control over the device after the sale. One such alternative is the exclusion of warranty under Article 2 of the Uniform Commercial Code, for aberrant consumers.\n\nThis article considers whether limitation of warranties may actually have the deterrence effect on consumers that manufacturers desire; said differently, the article weighs whether manufacturers can achieve their goals of preventing consumers from using their products in an unauthorized manner by removing warranty protections from the consumer. The Article presents a behavioral model based on the Triandis' model of planned behavior and enhances the model by accounting for likely and unlikely benefits and detriments. The model suggests that participants weigh the detrimental impact together with the probability and magnitude of the detriment against the beneficial impact together with the probability and magnitude of the benefit when making the decision to engage in technological piracy. Considering only half of the equation - what deterrents are likely to impact consumer behavior - the Article then reconciles the model to empirical evidence suggesting that Apple's warranty could be a stronger deterrent for consumers than civil liability.\n\nThe data collected suggests four observations of the survey pool: (1) known sanctions reduce the preference for engaging in technology piracy; (2) persons surveyed believe they are more likely to lose a warranty than face civil liability for engaging in technological piracy; (3) a better warranty enhances the magnitude of the warranty's benefit, and therefore raises the level of deterrence to nearly equal the deterrence level of civil liability; and (4) the magnitude, probability, and deterrent impact of both deterrents can be enhanced if consumer knowledge is improved. The article concludes that manufacturers can better protect their post-sale investment in property by raising consumer awareness of their warranty's quality and by raising awareness of the consequences for using the product in a way that is outside the terms of the consumers' authorized use.", "entities": ["Consumer_behaviour", "Intellectual_property", "Digital_Millennium_Copyright_Act", "X86_assembly_language", "Patent", "Empirical_evidence", "Firmware", "Face_book", "Copyright_infringement", "Mobile_phone", "IPhone", "Accounting", "Anti-circumvention", "Apple_Inc.", "Uniform_Commercial_Code"], "country": ["United States of America"], "authentic_link": "http://scholarship.law.duke.edu/dltr/vol9/iss1/17/", "citation_count": null, "literature_review": 0, "industries": ["Computer programming", "Software publishing (including video games)", "Creative, arts and entertainment"], "disciplines": ["Illegal Behavior and the Enforcement of Law", "Intellectual Property and Intellectual Capital"], "year": 2010.0, "label": "Limitation of Sales Warranties as an Alternative to Intellectual Property Rights: An Empirical Analysis of IPhone Warranties\u2019 Deterrent Impact on Consumers", "policies": ["Enforcement"], "link": "http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1351967"}, {"collection_methods": ["Quantitative Collection Methods", "Survey Research (quantitative; e.g. sales/income reporting)"], "data_description": "Field survey data from questionnaires completed by a self-selecting sample of 196 young students (93 males and 103 females) at a New Zealand university (2010)\n\nThe sample was representative of typical first year students from a range of study areas, and not limited by socio-economic, gender or ethnic differences.", "analysis_methods": ["Quantitative Analysis Methods", "Descriptive statistics (counting; means reporting; cross-tabulation)", "Regression analysis"], "authors": "Robertson, McNeill, Green and Roberts (2012)", "issues": ["Understanding consumption/use", "Relationship between protection"], "entity_count": {"Compact_disc": 1, "Copyright_infringement": 1, "Peer-to-peer": 1, "New_Zealand_national_rugby_league_team": 1, "Soil_erosion": 1, "Ethics": 1}, "wordcount": {"comparison": 1, "compared": 1, "to_deter": 1, "peer": 1, "offered": 1, "stealing": 1, "downloading": 5, "engagement": 2, "men": 3, "could": 1, "download": 1, "ethical": 2, "store": 1, "Findings": 1, "less": 3, "toward": 1, "concern": 2, "whether": 2, "similar": 2, "behaviours": 1, "alternative": 1, "Given": 1, "risk": 2, "revealed": 2, "peer_networks": 1, "also": 2, "concerned": 1, "illegal": 3, "varying": 1, "behaviour": 2, "sample": 1, "equally": 1, "likely_to": 1, "non": 2, "demonstrated": 1, "prevalent": 1, "CD": 2, "explain_why": 1, "more_likely": 1, "music": 2, "student": 1, "being_caught": 1, "results": 1, "legal_action": 1, "downloaders": 6, "recommendations": 1, "individual": 2, "levels": 1, "illegal_downloading": 1, "regarding": 1, "examined": 2, "law": 1, "study_examines": 1, "factors": 1, "they_would": 1, "characteristics": 2, "indicate_that": 1, "propensity": 1, "downloaded": 1, "unlikely": 1}, "plain_text_proposition": "* Downloading music is prevalent. 74.5% of the sampled students downloaded music.\n\n* The factors characterizing downloading are similar for men and women.

Paralleling discussions in patent law, scholars addressing the troll issue in copyright have applied status-based definitions to determine who is, and is not, a troll. This Article argues that the definition should be conduct-based. Multi-defendant John Doe litigation should be counted as part of copyright trolling whenever these suits are motivated by a desire to turn litigation into an independent revenue stream. Such litigation, when initiated with the aim of turning a profit in the courthouse as opposed to seeking compensation or deterring illegal activity, reflects a kind of systematic opportunism that fits squarely within the concept of litigation trolling. This Article shows that existing status-based definitions of copyright trolls are inapt because they do not account for what is now the most widely practiced from of trolling.\n\nIn addition to these empirical and theoretical contributions, this Article explores the features of copyright doctrine that have facilitated the recent explosion in trolling litigation in the form of litigation against John Does.

Most of these are formulated based on Article 10(2) of the Berne Convention. Although the details may differ, the first group of countries has exceptions that mirror the approach in Article 10(2), which is to provide a general exception to sanction the utilization of any work by way of illustration in publications, broadcasts or sound or visual recordings for teaching, to the extent justified by the purpose.  This includes the use of a work for instructional communication.  However, four countries have expressly limited their exceptions to reproductions only, and five have imposed the requirement of face-to-face teaching.  This is likely to create an issue as regards the application of these exceptions for distance and e-learning.\n\n*The second group of countries has implemented the Article 10(2) exception through the enumeration of excepted aspects of educational activities as exceptions.  The attendant conditions for these exceptions can vary in detail, but the excepted activities are chrestomathies, abstracts, educational performances and broadcasts, school textbooks, school rentals and examinations.  In the absence of a general or catch-all exception in their legislation, countries adopting the \u201cenumeration\u201d approach may need to constantly update their copyright exceptions to deal with new uses of works as part of educational instruction.  Given the increasing breadth and variation of educational curriculum, the choice of using a residual educational use exception based on the three-step test seems like a good solution. \n\n* Most countries have exceptions that exempt the personal or private use of works for research or private study purposes.  However, concerns about book piracy have led a first group of eight countries that have broad \u201cpersonal or private use\u201d exceptions to exclude from the scope of their exceptions the reprography of the whole or a substantial part of books or musical works.  The second group of countries addresses this problem with the concept of \u201cfair use\u201d that creates opportunities for individualistic determinations of permissible usage in each case.  The tension between the potential for \u201cfair use\u201d to serve as a residual exception to permit unanticipated uses of works that add to social utility and to create much harm from its misuse by end users and consumers to collectively make multiple copies of works is  unfortunately a tension that is inherent in the very principle of \u201cfair use\u201d itself (that of a relatively open-ended rule) which can be ameliorated with the recognition of various presumptions of \u201cfair use\u201d where the extent of the work copied is small or determined by the nature of the work e.g. an article in a periodical. \n\n* No less than 16 countries in the countries surveyed in this study have updated their copyright legislation with provisions to deal with technological measures.  However, only a few have provisions to deal with the issue of possible breach of laws protecting the breach of technological measures for educational purposes.  The growing proliferation of electronic books, compilations and databases that are digitally protected may pose challenges for educational institutions seeking to provide access to these legitimately acquired resources for instructional purposes (for instance, to enable multiple access or to make multiple copies of such works for distribution, when the technological measures only permit one copy to be made).", "comparative": 1, "intervention_response": "The complexities in this area of legislating for educational exceptions stem largely from the changes that technology is bringing to the field of education.

First, paying the P2P provider may transfer guilt and the problem of piracy to the P2P system provider. People may believe they are doing a good thing for both musicians and consumers by distributing good music, instead of hurting copyright holders. The large numbers on a P2P network and the anonymity of a computer-mediated environment may also create ethical ambiguity and lead to deindividuation. This leads to the negative effects of decreasing self- awareness and stimulating anti-normative behavior.\n\n*The Hunt\u2013Vitell model suggests that when behavior and intentions are inconsistent with ethical judgments, one of the consequences will be guilt (Hunt and Vitell, 1986).

The success of iTunes firmly supports this idea.\n\n*Companies should try to apply and realize the advantages of new technologies to increase consumers\u2019 benefits, instead of resisting change, simply declaring their rights, and imposing the guilt of piracy on consumers.

Higher levels of social acceptance led to stronger motivations to illegally download.\n\n*A previously researched result was reinforced: when moral conscience was low, desire to illegally download is high (Gopal et al., 2004). Rather than being an absolute measure of moral conscience (i.e., right vs. wrong), if we look at this through the social lens, we can see it more as a measure of what is deemed socially acceptable or unacceptable. \n\n*In personal and group interviews, the legal cost for downloading using on-campus servers was seen as extremely high. Most respondents had a friend, or had heard of someone, who had been caught and/or fined. Off campus, in the \u201creal world,\u201d however, respondents indicated that their fear of being caught was infinitesimally small. \n\n*With such a low perceived possibility of being caught, it is reasonable to theorize that the optimistic bias of college kids regarding legal costs grew to such an extent that legal costs no longer had the potential to act as a brake on illegal behavior.", "comparative": 0, "intervention_response": "Policy Implications reported in the study:\n\n*The music industry should not only be developing strategies to fight individual downloaders, as a focus on individual lawsuits does.

Aside from using on-campus servers, the perception of personal risk to college students is, today, very small. \n\n*A swift and drastic shift in perception would be important not just on an individual basis but because it could create a social tipping point among college peers.

Can average users exploit the analog hole, or is this limited to sophisticated users? Does analog hole copying significantly degrade the quality of music or video? Will people pay for music that isn't a perfect digital copy? Intuitions and guesses abound, but nobody has ever conducted a study to answer these questions. We have. Although our surveys' sample sizes were too small to come to statistically significant conclusions, we did discover several interesting results including one tantalizingly specific result: What's the analog hole worth? Based on our survey, twenty-four cents. That's how much less our respondents were willing to pay for a music track when a perfect digital copy was replaced by an analog hole copy. Although our results need to be replicated on a larger scale, they suggest many conclusions that have never before been proved: people are willing to pay for less-than-perfect analog hole copies of songs; people will pay much more than half the price of a typically-priced digital music file for its degraded alternative; and even self-avowed \\\"pirates\\\" show a willingness to pay for digital music, albeit at prices well below today's market standard of ninety-nine cents a song.", "entities": ["Digital_copy", "Analog_hole", "Digital_rights_management", "World_Wide_Web"], "country": ["United States of America"], "authentic_link": "http://www.jthtl.org/content/articles/V5I3/JTHTLv5i3_SickerOhmGunaji.PDF", "citation_count": null, "literature_review": 0, "industries": ["Sound recording and music publishing"], "disciplines": ["Entertainment \u2022 Media", "Innovation and Invention: Processes and Incentives", "Technological Change: Choices and Consequences \u2022 Diffusion Processes", "Intellectual Property and Intellectual Capital"], "year": 2007.0, "label": "The analog hole and the price of music: An empirical study", "policies": ["Licensing and Business models"], "link": "http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=969998"}, {"collection_methods": ["Qualitative Collection Methods", "Semi-structured interview"], "data_description": "32 interviews with media sellers and buyers at three international television trade fairs (Discop East Budapest in June 2008, Asia Television Forum Singapore in December 2008 and NATPE Las Vegas in January 2009).

They identified all copyright, patent, and trademark litigation involving the firms in the sample by matching on firm names, using IP litigation data from the Federal Judicial Center (FJC). Mergers and acquisitions among firms were also tracked to ensure that ongoing litigation was assigned to the correct successor firms.

This finding suggests that the prospect of publication with attribution has a modest but nonetheless statistically significant effect of reducing WTA compared to a situation where subjects are not offered the prospect of publication with attribution.\n\n*Given the strong preference for attribution, publication without attribution may be viewed negatively, which would account for the higher average WTA in the Publication condition versus the Contest condition (although this was not significant at the 0.05 confidence level).\n\n*The data also suggest that professional and advanced amateur photographers place a somewhat greater value on the prospect of publication with attribution compared with their amateur counterparts. The professional subjects\u2019 WTA in the Attribution condition was lower by a significant amount compared to the Contest subjects\u2019 WTA. This is fairly strong evidence that creators attach some substantial value to credited publication of their work.\n\n*The creators\u2019 behavior indicates that they valued attribution at $415.07. The professional and advanced amateur photographers value attribution far more than the casual snapshooters.\n\n*In the third experiment, subjects altered the amount of money they were willing to accept in ways that were consistent with placing a significant economic value on attribution.\n\n*This study suggests that a waivable default attribution rule could have a significant \u2013 and negative \u2013 effect on the efficiency of markets to license IP.\n\n*When the subjects were initially endowed with a right to attribution, they valued it substantially more than they did when they were not so endowed and had to purchase it.

On the other side of the Atlantic, however, many European countries give creators, at least in their copyright laws, much stronger rights to attribution. At first blush it may seem that the U.S. has gotten it wrong, and the Europeans have made a better policy choice in providing to creators a right that they value. But for reasons we will explain in this Article, matters are much more complicated.\nThis Article reports a series of experiments that are the first to attempt to measure quantitatively the value of attribution to creators. In previous research, we have shown that creators of IP are subject to a \u201ccreativity effect\u201d that results in their assigning substantially higher value to their works than neoclassical economic theory predicts. The first two experiments reported in this Article suggest a way that the creativity effect may be reduced: creators are willing to sacrifice significant economic payments in favor of receiving attribution for their work. The value to creators of attribution raises the question whether U.S. IP law should be restructured to provide attribution as a creator\u2019s default right.\nThe third and most important experiment reported here casts doubt on the value of giving creators such a default right, because creators value attribution differently depending on whether the legal rule gives it to them as an initial entitlement or not. When creators are given a right to attribution as a default, they value credit four times higher than when attribution is not the default option. Our findings make clear that creators value attribution, and that the prospect of obtaining it can lead to a more efficient level of transacting. At the same time, paradoxically, our findings suggest that we should exercise caution before we restructure U.S. law, which provides no right to attribution for the vast majority of creators. Indeed, it is possible, under conditions that we will describe, that providing creators with a default right to attribution will result in less efficient transacting.\nFinally, our findings have implications for property theory which are broader than IP law or attribution rights. Our third experiment suggests that a party who enjoys a default legal right as part of her initial complement of rights will tend to treat that legal right in a fashion similar to any other form of initial entitlement, and overvalue it relative to what neoclassical theory would predict. This suggests a principle regarding how to efficiently structure default rules in any setting. All other factors being equal, an efficiently structured default rule will locate the initial legal entitlement in the party who is either less likely to overvalue the entitlement, or, if overvaluation seems inevitable regardless of where the initial entitlement is placed, is likely to overvalue it less.", "entities": ["Intellectual_property", "The_Atlantic", "Empirical_evidence", "Creativity", "Amazon_Mechanical_Turk", "Transaction_cost", "Neoclassical_economics", "VAST"], "country": ["United States of America"], "authentic_link": "http://scholarship.kentlaw.iit.edu/fac_schol/733/", "citation_count": null, "literature_review": 0, "industries": ["Creative, arts and entertainment"], "disciplines": ["Mathematical and Quantitative Methods", "Design of Experiments", "Laboratory; Individual Behavior", "Microeconomics", "Behavioral Microeconomics \u2022 Underlying Principles"], "year": 2012.0, "label": "What's a name worth?: Experimental tests of the value of attribution in intellectual property", "policies": ["Nature and Scope of exclusive rights"], "link": "http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2011403"}, {"collection_methods": ["Qualitative Collection Methods"], "data_description": "The author analysis the sections of the Copyright, Design, and Patents Act 1988 constituting the new framework for copyright exceptions in the UK", "analysis_methods": ["Qualitative Analysis Methods"], "authors": "Stannard (2015)", "issues": ["Understanding consumption/use"], "entity_count": {"European_Union": 1, "Precedent": 1, "Fair_dealing": 1, "Great_Britain": 1, "Limitations_and_exceptions_to_copyright": 1, "World_Wide_Web": 1}, "wordcount": {"copyright": 1, "European_Union": 1, "reflects": 1, "changes": 1, "dealing": 1, "reference": 1, "discusses": 1, "sense": 1, "professionals": 2, "detail": 1, "particularly": 1, "Market": 1, "recent": 1, "provisions": 1, "working": 1, "national": 1, "impact": 1, "within": 2, "context": 1, "statutory": 2, "remain": 1, "information": 2, "legislation": 1, "sectors": 1, "education": 1, "necessary": 1, "provide": 1, "instruments": 1, "new": 1, "initiatives": 1, "making": 1, "especially": 1, "significant_impact": 1, "as_well": 1, "considered": 1, "article": 1, "also": 1, "case_law": 1, "cultural_heritage": 1, "fair": 1, "copyright_law": 1, "informed": 1}, "plain_text_proposition": "* As to the text and data analysis exception, research libraries in particular acknowledge that their researchers benefit from performing computational analysis on large amounts of information.

By focusing only on the IPR-intensive industries, this study arguably understates the real contribution of IP rights to the European economy.\n\nSuch IPR-intensive industries are shown to have generated almost 26% of all jobs in the EU during\nthe period 2008-2010, with almost 21% in trade mark-intensive industries, 12% in design-intensive\nindustries, 10% in patent-intensive industries, and smaller proportions in copyright-intensive and GI-intensive industries.6 On average over this period, 56.5 million Europeans were employed by IPR-intensive industries, out of a total employment of approximately 218 million. In addition, another 20 million jobs were generated in industries that supply goods and services to the IPR-intensive industries. Taking indirect jobs into account, the total number of IPR\u2011dependent jobs rises to just under 77 million (35.1%).\n\nOver the same period, IPR-intensive industries generated almost 39% of total economic activity\n(GDP) in the EU, worth \u20ac 4.7 trillion. They also accounted for most of the EU\u2019s trade with the rest of the world, with design-intensive, copyright-intensive and GI-intensive industries generating a trade surplus. IPR-intensive industries also pay significantly higher wages than other industries, with a wage premium of more than 40%. This is consistent with the fact that the value added per worker is higher in IPR-intensive industries than elsewhere in the economy.\n\nIn addition to their direct employment contribution, IPR-intensive industries also generate employment in other, non\u2011IPR-intensive industries which supply them with goods and services as inputs to their production processes. Using the EU27 Input Output Tables, published by Eurostat, it is possible to calculate this indirect effect on employment in non\u2011IPR\u2011intensive industries. The result is summarised in table 2, which shows a breakdown by direct and indirect employment. Including the indirect jobs in the calculation implies that 35.1% of EU jobs are contributed by the IPR-intensive industries, directly and indirectly.\n\nBesides employment, IPR-intensive industries contribute to economic output, as measured by Gross Domestic Product (GDP). Overall, almost 39% of EU GDP is generated in IPR-intensive industries, with trade mark-intensive industries accounting for 34%, design-intensive industries for 13%, patent-intensive industries for 14% and copyright and GI-intensive industries for smaller proportions. Chapter 6 provides a more detailed breakdown of these industries\u2019 contributions to the national economies of the EU Member States.\n\nComparing the results of this EU study with those for the US reveals that the two economies have a similar structure, as is to be expected given their similar level of development. However, in terms of the contribution of IPR-intensive industries, the shares in employment and GDP are somewhat higher in the EU: 26% vs. 19% for employment and 39% vs. 35% for GDP. However, in both studies, trade mark-intensive industries account for the highest shares in both employment and GDP, followed by patents and copyright in the US and by designs, patents and copyright in the EU. Similarly, the wage premiums in IPR-intensive industries compared to other industries are similar: 41% in the EU and 42% in the US, with copyright-intensive and patent intensive industries having the highest premiums on both sides of the Atlantic.\nGiven that 39% of GDP (value added) in the economy and 26% of employment is generated in IPRintensive industries, the value added per employee is higher in IPR-intensive industries than in the rest of the economy. Economic theory suggests that, all else being equal, industries in which the average worker produces more value added can be expected to pay their workers higher wages than other industries. It is therefore of relevance to examine whether this higher value added is reflected in the relative wages in the IPR\u2011intensive industries.\n\nWages in IPR-intensive industries are indeed higher than in non-IPR\u2011intensive industries. The average weekly wage in IPR-intensive industries is \u20ac 715, compared with \u20ac 507 in non\u2011IPR\u2011intensive industries \u2013 a difference of 41%. This \u201cwage premium\u201d is 31% in design-intensive industries, 42% in trade mark-intensive industries, 46% in GI-intensive industries, 64% in patent-intensive industries and 69% in copyright-intensive industries.\n\nFinally, the role played by IPR-intensive industries in the EU\u2019s external trade is examined. The bulk of EU trade is in IPR-intensive industries. It may be somewhat surprising at first glance that such a high share of imports is IPR-intensive. This is because even industries producing commodities such as energy are IPR-intensive, while on the other hand, many non-IPR-intensive activities are also non-tradable. For that reason, 88% of EU imports consist of products of IPR-intensive industries.\n\nHowever, an even higher share of EU exports, 90% is accounted for by IPR-intensive industries. The EU as a whole had a trade deficit of approximately \u20ac174 billion, or 1.4% of GDP. Since the IPR-intensive industries as a whole account for a higher share of EU exports than EU imports, they make a positive contribution to the Union\u2019s trade position. The EU has a trade deficit in trademark-intensive and patent-intensive products, to some degree offset by trade surpluses in copyright intensive, design-intensive, and GI-intensive industries.", "comparative": 1, "intervention_response": "It makes no policy recommendations, as this is not within its scope.

Comparative data from the 1996, 2001 and 2006 Censuses can be used to examine changes over this period. These data indicate that the size of the creative workforce as defined above grew by almost 40 per cent in the period 1996\u20132006, a compound growth rate of about 3 per cent per annum. The growth was particularly spurred by increases in numbers in the design professions, which grew at an annual rate of about 6 per cent. The growth in the creative workforce is reflective of structural changes that have been occurring in the economy in recent years, as traditional manufacturing and service industries gradually give way to information and knowledge-based industries in the socalled new economy. Technological changes in communications and information processing have contributed significantly to these shifts, and the consequences can be observed in employment levels. For example, the increase in numbers in the design professions noted above can be contrasted with the decline in more traditional areas such as printing; the numbers of printing tradespeople have fallen by 25 per cent over the last decade.   \n\n* In regard to the importance of creativity in economic life, the author has noted the growing interest in the world at large in the emerging concept of the creative economy, centred on the creative or cultural industries. Australia has experienced somewhat the same patterns of growth in its creative sector as have other countries, when observed in terms of contribution to GDP or to employment. To some extent this has happened without significant policy intervention, at least at the Federal level; the grand 1990s vision of Creative Nation was not pursued by the Commonwealth Government after 1996, and initiatives to promote cultural industry development over the last decade have mainly arisen at State level, as a component of urban and regional policy\u2014in particular the rhetoric of \u2018creative cities\u2019 has been enthusiastically espoused around the country, and this shows no signs of abating. Thus although Australia may not unequivocally be described as a creative economy at the present time, there are certainly elements in the system which are pointing in that direction. But a stronger policy involvement, especially at the Federal level, is likely to be needed in the future if Australia is to maintain or enhance its established and emerging strengths in the development of creative skills across the economy at large. \n\n*The core components of the country\u2019s cultural sector\u2014the creative artists, the performing companies, the galleries, museums and libraries, the heritage sites, and the public broadcasting system\u2014are all well-established. Despite periodic fluctuations across the political cycle, bipartisan support for public funding provided for cultural purposes by Federal, State and local governments remains reasonably stable.51 Nevertheless the per capita levels of such funding are by no means generous in comparison with other countries of comparable wealth. \n\n*This project provides a vivid illustration of the value of the Census in shedding light on aspects of contemporary Australian society. Census data, of course, have the enormous advantage of comprehensiveness and accuracy, avoiding the problems of sampling bias and difficulties of statistical inference that characterise the use of data derived from surveys. In the present project the identification of the creative workforce has been a central task, made possible by the fact that the Census provides labour market data to a high degree of occupational specificity, together with industry definitions that enable the clear delineation of the cultural sector of the economy. In addition, the ability to trace locational aspects to the finest level of disaggregation has allowed the testing of hypotheses concerning the existence of so-called creative cities in various parts of the country. Future Censuses are likely to be even more useful in their application to analysis of the cultural sector if the revised framework for cultural statistics currently being developed at an international level is finally agreed upon and adopted in Australia.", "comparative": 0, "intervention_response": "* At the 2020 Ideas Summit mentioned in the Introduction to this paper, a major theme pursued by the Creative Australia group focused on the centrality of creativity to Australian society and the Australian economy.

If these sorts of ideas are taken up, not just by governments but more widely across the community, the concept of Creative Australia is likely to grow in strength and recognition in the coming years.", "url": "http://www.copyrightevidence.org/evidence-wiki/index.php/Throsby_(2008)", "type": "Study", "government_or_policy": 0, "abstract": "At least three distinct aspects can be identified and each raises a series of questions as to the role of creativity in contemporary Australian life.\n* Creative work:  Significant numbers of people work in jobs that involve the exercise of creative skills. Is it possible to identify a creative workforce and to assess its contribution to the Australian economy? And are these workers employed in sectors of the economy that could be thought of as the creative industries? \n* Creative class:  A lot of attention has been focused recently on the proposition that creative people tend to cluster in particular urban environments, stimulating economic growth and social interaction. Such people have been referred to as a \u2018creative class\u2019. Does this concept have any relevance to cities in Australia? And can we describe any of the State or Territory capitals as a \u2018creative city\u2019? \n* Creative participation:  Australians spend their leisure time in a variety of ways, many of which could be referred to as creative. Active involvement in the arts, through painting, singing, playing a musical instrument, writing, dancing and so on all involve the development and application of creative skills. Moreover, participation in the arts as a consumer\u2014visiting art galleries, reading novels, going to the theatre\u2014all involve a form of creative engagement. How important are such activities in Australian life today?\n\nThis paper addresses all three of these aspects of creativity in Australian society at the present time. The central proposition to be explored is that the somewhat vague idea of Creative Australia can indeed be given conceptual and empirical substance, thanks particularly to the rich sources of data provided by the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS). Quite a lot is already known about many statistical aspects of the arts and culture in Australia as a result of the longstanding efforts of the Statistics Working Group of the Cultural Ministers\u2019 Council and the dedicated work of the National Centre for Culture and Recreation Statistics of the ABS located in Adelaide.

The data reviewed in this study indicates that the many costs of such an approach, including costs to economic innovation, freedom of expression, and personal privacy, need not be tolerated.

Publishers subjected to it on a massive scale have seen their revenues and profits soar. They are racing past the economy as a whole. One way in which mass digitization may impact the publishing industry beneficially is by vastly expanding public and competitor access to not only substantive knowledge in general, but knowledge about books, the book market, and book prices in particular. Rather than an hour-long trip to the bookstore to walk up and down aisles and check shelves for availability and both covers for pricing, GBS represents a portal to massive online bookstore, library, and public domain holdings. Unlike the books in a bookstore, GBS allows searching for specific words and concepts, and limiting\nthe results one sees by year of publication, author\u2019s name, publisher, and other important criteria.

This Article challenges the conventional wisdom propounded by the U.S. and German governments, as well as Microsoft and other competitors of Google, concerning the likely economic impact of mass book-digitization projects. Originally advanced by publishing industry lobbying groups, the prevailing account of mass book-digitization projects is that they will devastate authors and publishers, just as Napster and its heirs have supposedly devastated musicians and music labels. Using the impact of GBS on the revenues and operating incomes of U.S. publishers believing themselves to be the most-affected by it, this Article finds no evidence of a negative impact upon them. To the contrary, it provides some evidence of a positive impact, and proposes further empirical research to identify the mechanisms of digitization\u2019s economic impact. \n\nThe debate surrounding the GBS settlement is important to students, writers, researchers, and the general public, as it may decide whether a federal appellate court or even the U.S. Supreme Court allows the best research tool ever designed to survive.

The recommendations set forth herein reflect all of these considerations.The Copyright Office hereby makes the following recommendations to effectuate a phase-out of\nthe statutory licenses:\n\n\u2022 Copyright owners should be permitted to develop marketplace licensing options to replace the provisions of Sections 111, 119 and 122, working with broadcasters, cable operators, satellite carriers, and other licensees, while taking into account consumer demands.\n\n\u2022 Business models based on sublicensing, collective licensing and/or direct licensing are largely undeveloped in the broadcast retransmission context, but they are feasible alternatives to securing the public performance rights necessary to retransmit copyrighted content.\n\n\u2022 The options of sublicensing, collective licensing, and direct licensing do not represent the entire universe of possibilities, are not mutually exclusive, and will not remain static. Business models may emerge that incorporate these concepts in part or in combination, and technology will continuously inform the practices of both licensors and licensees. Over time, marketplace licensing should evolve in a variety of innovative ways, subject to investment and experimentation in the marketplace.\n\n\u2022 The Copyright Office recommends that Congress provide a date-specific trigger for the phase-out and eventual repeal of the distant signal licenses, building in sufficient time for a measured and orderly transition period.\n\n\u2022 Before determining the date-specific trigger and transition period for the phase-out of the distant signal licenses, the Copyright Office recommends that Congress evaluate the concerns of stakeholders who operate with limited resources in the broadcast programming distribution chain and determine whether special consideration is advisable.\n\n\u2022 During the transition period, the Section 111, 119, and 122 statutory licenses should not apply to any broadcast station that has obtained the rights to retransmit all of the content carried on its signal, provided that the local broadcast station forgoes its mandatory carriage rights under the United States Copyright Office STELA \u00a7 302 REPORT 140 must-carry and carry-one carry-all provisions of the Communications Act. This \u201cstation-bystation\u201d option would apply to all broadcast stations, including those in distant markets. Under this option, MVPDs would be required to negotiate directly with the broadcast station for carriage of the programming on the broadcast signal.\n\n\u2022 The Copyright Office recommends that Congress delay the phase-out and repeal of the local\nsignal licenses to a later time. This approach would provide stakeholders with an opportunity to test new business models with the least likelihood of disruption to consumers, and give Congress the advantage of drawing on that experience when considering when and how to address the local signal licenses.\n\n\u2022 The Copyright Office recommends that Congress carefully consider the communications law and\npolicy implications of repealing the statutory licensing system.", "comparative": 0, "intervention_response": "* The Copyright Office recommends that Congress provide a date-specific trigger for the phase-out and eventual repeal of the distant signal licenses, but leave repeal of the local signal licenses to a later time.

There are sound policy reasons to address this inequity,\nincluding the constitutionally-rooted objective to incentivize the creation and\ndissemination of artistic works.\n\n\u2022 While a resale royalty could be one of many factors affecting the location of auctions and other art sales, there is no evidence to conclusively establish that it would harm the U.S.visual art market. Studies produced since this Office last examined the issue in 1992\nbelie earlier assumptions that a resale royalty would substantially reduce prices in the\nprimary art market or shift the secondary art market away from the United States.\n\n\u2022 Although adoption of a resale royalty right is one option to address the disparate\ntreatment of artists under the law, it is not the only option, and more deliberation is\nnecessary to determine if it is the best option. The Office\u2019s 1992 report highlighted the\nfact that resale royalties appear to benefit only an extremely small number of artists.\nCurrent studies and reports remain consistent with this view.

Indeed, U.S. copyright law derives\nfundamentally from the principle that authors\u2019 interests are inseparable from the broader public interest. While \u201c[t]he immediate effect of our copyright law is to secure a fair return for an \u2018author\u2019s\u2019 creative labor,\u201d the \u201cultimate aim is . . . to stimulate artistic creativity for the general public good.\u201d Accordingly, to the extent that the current copyright system is not working effectively for authors \u2013 or is disfavoring a discrete class of authors \u2013 Congress should be concerned.\n\nIn the framework of the resale royalty discussions, the authors at issue are certain visual\nartists, including painters, illustrators, sculptors, and photographers (hereinafter \u201cvisual artists\u201d or \u201cartists\u201d). Based on the information and comments provided during the preparation of this report, as well as the Office\u2019s independent research, the Office agrees that, under the current legal system, visual artists are uniquely limited in their ability to fully benefit from the success of their works over time. The distinctive nature of the creation and marketing of visual art has not changed since the Office\u2019s main study on the topic, published in 1992. At the same time, recent developments \u2013 including in particular the adoption of resale royalty laws by more than thirty additional countries since the Office\u2019s prior report \u2013 would seem to warrant renewed consideration of the issue.\n\nIn general, visual artists do not share in the long-term financial success of their works.\nInstead, the financial gains from the resale of their works inure primarily to third parties such as auction houses, collectors, and art galleries. Moreover, the income typically available to other authors through reproduction and derivative uses of their works is more limited for artists. Although the Internet has provided artists with greater opportunities to exploit derivative images and/or sell mass-produced copies of their works, stakeholders agree that \u201cfor most visual artists . . . the amounts involved in reproduction or representation are generally insignificant.\u201d Indeed, it appears to be common ground that reproduction rights represent a \u201cvery minor aspect of [most artists\u2019] careers\u201d and that the first sale of a work is \u201cthe main or exclusive source of income for almost all American artists.\u201d\n\nThe Copyright Office agrees that these factors place many visual artists at a material\ndisadvantage vis-\u00e0-vis other authors, and therefore the Office supports congressional\nconsideration of a resale royalty right, or droit de suite,8 which would give artists a percentage of the amount paid for a work each time it is resold by another party. A large and growing number of countries around the world \u2013 more than seventy in total \u2013 now follow that approach. Other potential responses might include the facilitation of voluntary initiatives among stakeholders in the art market, amending the copyright law to give artists a continuing economic interest in their works through, for example, greater interests in public display or commercial rental rights, and increased federal grants for visual art programs. \n\nThat said, an \u201cinformation problem\u201d in the art market \u2013 something that many have acknowledged \u2013 does present certain challenges. Any assessment of the treatment of visual artists under U.S. law suffers from a lack of independently verifiable data about the operation of the art market and a resulting difficulty in determining whether a resale royalty in particular would truly operate to place artists on equal footing with other authors. At the same time, the Office recognizes that many of the arguments against the right are overblown.

The tribunal would be staffed by three\nadjudicators, two of whom would have significant experience in copyright law \u2013 together\nhaving represented or presided over the interests of both owners and users of copyrighted\nworks \u2013 with the third to have a background in alternative dispute resolution.\n\n\u2022 The tribunal would be a voluntary alternative to federal court. Its focus would be on\nsmall infringement cases valued at no more than $30,000 in damages. Copyright owners\nwould be required to have registered their works or filed an application before bringing\nan action. They would be eligible to recover either actual or statutory damages up to the\n$30,000 cap, but statutory damages would be limited to $15,000 per work (or $7,500 for\na work not registered by the normally applicable deadline for statutory damages).\n\n\u2022 Claimants who initiated a proceeding would provide notice of the claim to responding\nparties, who would need to agree to the process, either through an opt-out mechanism or\nby affirmative written consent. Respondents would be permitted to assert all relevant\ndefenses, including fair use, as well as limited counterclaims arising from the infringing\nconduct at issue. Certain DMCA-related matters relating to takedown notices, including\nclaims of misrepresentation, could also be considered, and parties threatened with an\ninfringement action could seek a declaration of noninfringement.\n\n\u2022 Parties would provide written submissions and hearings would be conducted through\ntelecommunications facilities. Proceedings would be streamlined, with limited discovery\nand no formal motion practice. A responding party\u2019s agreement to cease infringing\nactivity could be considered by the tribunal and reflected in its determination. The\ntribunal would retain the discretion to dismiss without prejudice any claim that it did not\nbelieve could fairly be adjudicated through the small claims process.\n\n\u2022 Determinations of the small claims tribunal would be binding only with respect to the\nparties and claims at issue and would have no precedential effect. They would be subject\nto limited administrative review for error and could be challenged in federal district court\nfor fraud, misconduct, or other improprieties. Final determinations could be filed in\nfederal court, if necessary, to ensure their enforceability.", "comparative": 1, "intervention_response": "Based on input from roundtables and Notices for Inquiry, the Copyright Office recommends the creation of a small claims copyright court to best serve creators and authors.", "url": "http://www.copyrightevidence.org/evidence-wiki/index.php/United_States_Copyright_Office_(2013b)", "type": "Study", "government_or_policy": 1, "abstract": "As provided in the Constitution, the rights granted to authors are not merely to be articulated, but also \u201csecur[ed].\\\" Unfortunately, and perhaps ironically, as the rate of infringement has increased, so too have the barriers to pursuing copyright claims in the federal courts. These barriers are largely practical: federal litigation is expensive and time-consuming, and therefore out of reach for many copyright owners. The problem is especially vexing in the context of small claims, where the injury may be limited or difficult to measure. If exclusive rights are unenforceable, they are weakened as the pillars of the copyright law, and public respect for our nation\u2019s creativity is eroded in turn. The problem of modest-sized copyright claims, on the one hand, and costly enforcement, on the other, appears to be especially acute for individual creators. \n\nIn comments submitted to the Copyright Office in the course of this study, the Graphic Artists Guild wrote that \u201c[a]s a practical matter, except for large corporate copyright owners, our current copyright laws are virtually unenforceable when it comes to the infringement of visual works.\u201d In a similar vein, American Photographic Artists explained that \u201cthe current system deters authors from asserting their rights, renders these cases difficult for any attorney to take on, and encourages copyright infringement by all phases of society.\u201d The Alliance for Visual Artists pointed out that \u201c[t]he traditional method of protecting copyrights \u2026 is simply impracticable for a small business photographer with limited income.\u201d Observing that \u201c[w]e weaken markets for valuable goods at our collective peril,\u201d the Authors Guild reported that a majority of authors surveyed saw the need forthat while \u201c[s]uch small claims and random infringements may seem unimportant, \u2026 taken in the aggregate, they have an effect on the livelihoods of individual creators akin to the infamous torture \u2018death by a thousand cuts.\u2019\u201d \n\nCreators are not alone in voicing these concerns. Citing the \u201chindrances that currently exist in preventing copyright owners from pursuing copyright claims of relatively small economic value,\u201d the American Bar Association\u2019s Section of Intellectual Property Law offered recommendations in support of \u201ca much needed avenue for small copyright claims adjudication.\u201d Organizations that provide pro bono assistance to lower-income artists, such as California Lawyers for the Arts and the New York-based Volunteer Lawyers for the Arts, emphasized what they saw as a pressing need for alternatives to federal litigation. \n\nFinally, the frustrations of those seeking to defend against claims of infringement \u2013 who\nthemselves may be smaller actors and who also face high litigation costs \u2013 cannot be overlooked.

Having considered the plethora of issues that plague our current licensing system\u2014and how they might practically be addressed\u2014the Office has identified some additional principles that it believes should also guide any process of reform. These are:\n* Government licensing processes should aspire to treat like uses of music alike;\n* Government supervision should enable voluntary transactions while still supporting collective solutions;\n* Ratesetting and enforcement of antitrust laws should be separately managed and addressed;\n* A single, market\u2010oriented ratesetting standard should apply to all music uses under statutory licenses.", "comparative": 0, "intervention_response": "The report suggests a thorough restructuring of the music licensing system by congressional legislation, a Copyright Office review of the system several years following implementation, and a narrowing or expansion (particularly of 'opt-out' rights) into other areas of copyright protection, depending on the marketplace effect.

Our licensing system is founded on a view that the music marketplace requires a unique level of government regulation, much of it reflected in statutory licensing provisions of the Copyright Act. The Copyright Office believes that the time is ripe to question the existing paradigm for the licensing of musical works and sound recordings and consider meaningful change.\n\nThere is a widespread perception that our licensing system is broken. Songwriters and recording artists are concerned that they cannot make a living under the existing structure, which raises serious and systemic concerns for the future. Music publishers and performance rights organizations are frustrated that so much of their licensing activity is subject to government control, so they are constrained in the marketplace. Record labels and digital services complain that the licensing process is burdensome and inefficient, making it difficult to innovate.\n\nWhile there is general consensus that the system needs attention, there is less agreement as to what should be done. In this report, after reviewing the existing framework and stakeholders\u2019 views, the Copyright Office offers a series of guiding principles and preliminary recommendations for change.

This renders the overall welfare effects of file sharing robustly positive.\n\n*For example, the authors state that the consumer surplus created by music sharing in the Netherlands amounts to an estimated minimum of \u20ac200 million per year; a conservative estimate. At most half this amount is generated at the expense of the producer surplus and therefore constitutes a transfer of welfare. The remainder constitutes welfare gains.\n\n*The film industry is feeling the file-sharing pain less than is the music business, but this looks about to change as broadband is rolled out further. \n\n*The 'digitally native' games industry would seem better positioned to respond to the impact of file sharing, although some segments of the market, particularly the one for PC games, witnesses effects similar to the music industry. \n\n*The survey held among Dutch Internet users has shown that file sharing is here to stay and that people who download are at the same time important customers of the entertainment industry; therefore criminalising them makes no sense.", "comparative": 0, "intervention_response": "Policy implications include: \n\n*For a considerable amount of time, the industry remained unable to stem the tide of unlicensed music file sharing with their conservative strategy of abstaining from innovation, promoting legal measures against supposed offences and digital rights management. This strategy resulted in the current backlash, providing space for a new entrant establishing a major brand in the online music business: Apple's iTunes. \n\n*Reinvention of the business model looks like the only way out for the traditional players in the music industry. The music economy appears to be facing a shift in spending away from recordings to concert tickets and, to a lesser degree, merchandise. The advance of so called 360-degree artist contracts is a step towards greater diversification of sources of income and underlines the clear connection that exists between various revenue sources in different music markets: recordings, live music and merchandise. \n\n*The entertainment industry should step outside the box of the traditional value chain and venture into a host of other markets through the creation of value networks. \n\n*A strategy that focuses solely on lawsuits and digital rights management (DRM) is not the best response, in particular as it remains to be seen whether a fully authorised, paid-for downloading market would generate sufficient revenues to stay in business. Even in a hypothetical future without file sharing, a hybrid business model would appear to be the solution.\n\n*And so the entertainment industry will have to work actively towards innovation on all fronts. New models worth developing, for example, are those that seek to achieve commercial diversification or that match supply and end-user needs more closely.

On the other hand, extending the term makes the production of intellectual property more profitable, increasing the supply of works. The optimal term balances out these two effects. \n* A clever monopolist might use pre-emptive pricing and set an initial price low enough to discourage sharing. In the limit-pricing equilibrium, the surplus is shared between the monopolist and the consumer. This outcome is due to the fact that the possibility of sharing operates like a competitor for the monopolist, constraining the price that it can charge. Since the monopolist\u2019s price and profit is increasing in the transactions cost of sharing, the monopolist would like these transactions costs to be as large as possible. Hence, it would be interested in seeing greater enforcement of antipiracy laws, technologies that make it costly to copy and similar measure that make copying more costly to consumers.\n* Now that most information is born digital and that digital information is typically very easy to copy and distribute, it is conceivable that copyright laws may become almost impossible to enforce. Some business models might help sellers supporting themselves in an environment without effective copyright: 1) Make the original cheaper than a copy; 2) Make a copy more expensive than the original; 3) Sell physical complements; 4) Sell information complements; 5) Subscriptions; 6) Sell a personalized version; 7) Selling works with digital fingerprints (encoding the identity of the purchaser); 8) Advertise oneself; 9) Advertise other things; 10) Monitoring; 11) Site licenses; 12) Media tax; 13) Ransom; 14) Pure public provision; 15) Prizes, awards and commissions\n- Copyright is a second-best solution to intellectual property provision. Perhaps the ultimate saving grace is that the same technological advances that are making digital content inexpensive to copy are also helping to reduce the fixed cost of content creation. Hundreds of thousands of people are giving away digital content, from blogs to garage video to open source software. The increased availability of content due to the reduction in the cost of creating and distributing it will presumably increase competition and reduce the price consumers pay for legitimate access to content.\n- It is highly unlikely that free content alone will meet all of society\u2019s needs for content.

The system applies automatically to all right holders in a given field, even unknown or untraceable. However in Europe, the ECL system functions only in few countries on a large scale. Although the Copyright Directive does not contain any provisions in relation to neither orphan works nor the management of rights, point 18 of its Preamble provides that the Directive remains without prejudice to any arrangements of Member States concerning management of rights, such as extended collective licensing.  \n\n*A model based on a non-exclusive licence is different as it requires the active role of an independent body which has the power to issue a non-exclusive licence. This system requires providing diligent search for the right holders prior to the use of orphan works and paying a fee. In the European Union only the UK law foresees the possibility of issuing a nonexclusive licence but the system has a relatively narrow scope. The UK Copyright Tribunal can issue consent for use of orphan works only in relation to sound recordings. On a large scale this system so far only applies in Canada. The Hungarian provisions that foresee a similar system are still under the form of proposal. It seems also, that Member States can legally introduce provisions establishing a mechanism of issuing a non-exclusive licence by an administrative or public body without prejudice to the Copyright Directive. \n\n*The third option, a model based on limitation or exception to copyrights, does not function for the moment in any legislation. The concept however, is similar to the \u2018Canadian model\u2019 in the sense that the user has to provide the diligence search prior to use. The main difference is that as the user could use the work under an exception to copyrights, there is no administrative body to control if the search for the right holder has been diligent enough and secondly, that the fee would be payable only after the reappearance of the right holder. This solution, for the moment, is not compatible however with EU legislation as the Copyright Directive does not foresee any possibility for Member States to introduce new exceptions or limitations to copyrights (the list of possible exceptions and limitations to copyrights in the Directive is exhaustive). That is why the solution of the UK would require changing the European copyright law prior to introducing a new limitation to copyright in UK legislation.  \n\n*The problem of orphan works is very complex, especially because of the cross-border aspect of digitisation and following the reuse of digital material. Still, the majority of countries in the European Union do not have any legislation concerning use of orphan works.

It is therefore essential that mechanisms adopted by Member States are interoperable and that there is a system of mutual recognition of adopted solutions between countries. In the case where Member States do not foresee to undertake any steps to create a mechanism for use of orphan works, it would not be possible to achieve interoperability within the EU. In such a situation it would be necessary to implement a mechanism enabling the use of orphan works at European level.

For instance, analogue material can be republished on the Internet websites, released on DVD or new compilations of old material can be produced. Also different cultural institutions can take advantage of the new opportunities opened up by digital technology. Museums, archives and libraries are involved in the digitisation of their collections of cultural and scientific material. In the case of the activities carried out by cultural institutions, the purpose of digitisation is often not only to preserve cultural and scientific material but also to provide users with access to their resources, including access online. To promote digitisation, online accessibility and preservation of digital material of cultural institutions, the European Commission launched the \\\"i2010: Digital Libraries\\\" programme1 in September 2005. Before digitising and further reutilising material that is still in copyright, the prospective user must often obtain consent from the copyright owner. The problem appears when it is impossible to find or locate right holders or when right holders remain unknown. This is the problem of so called \u2018orphan works\u2019. Where it is impossible to get suitable permission from the owner, digitisation and further exploitation of the material might not take place. Such a situation is to the detriment not only of the user, but generally speaking, of the public, as no-one profits from cultural material left unexploited due to its orphan status.   Discussions on how to deal with orphan works are currently being undertaken by stakeholders and cultural and collective management institutions at different levels and scopes. Some of them have been initiated by the stakeholders themselves, others by the European Commission or by Member States. Generally speaking, the aim of these discussions is to find a solution to facilitate the use of orphan material without prejudice to copyright. The eventual solution should provide legal certainty both to users and right holders, should the right holders reappear after the use of orphan works was made without their explicit consent.   The objective of this report is to give a general overview of the situation of orphan works in the European Union. The report describes possible legislative solutions to the issue, as well as main actions that are currently underway in this field.", "entities": ["Orphan_works", "Legal_certainty", "European_Commission", "World_Wide_Web", "DVD", "GeneRally", "Digital_library", "European_Union"], "country": ["Austria", "Belgium", "Bulgaria", "Croatia", "Cyprus", "Czech Republic", "Denmark", "Estonia", "Finland", "France", "Germany", "Greece", "Hungary", "Ireland", "Italy", "Latvia", "Lithuania", "Luxembourg", "Malta", "Netherlands", "Poland", "Portugal", "Romania", "Slovakia", "Slovenia", "Spain", "Sweden", "United Kingdom"], "authentic_link": "http://ec.europa.eu/newsroom/dae/document.cfm?doc_id=6591", "citation_count": 1.0, "literature_review": 0, "industries": ["Publishing of books, periodicals and other publishing", "Cultural education"], "disciplines": ["Intellectual Property and Intellectual Capital", "Government Policy"], "year": 2008.0, "label": "The Problem of Orphan Works in the EU An overview of legislative solutions and main actions in this field", "policies": ["Mass digitisation/orphan works"], "link": "http://ec.europa.eu/newsroom/dae/document.cfm?doc_id=6591"}, {"collection_methods": ["Qualitative Collection Methods", "Case study"], "data_description": "The article describes a new model in organisation science: the \u201cprivate-collective\u201d model of innovation", "analysis_methods": ["Qualitative Analysis Methods"], "authors": "Von Hippel and Von Krogh (2003)", "issues": ["Relationship between protection", "Understanding consumption/use"], "entity_count": {"Organization_Science_(journal)": 1, "Open_source": 1, "Genealogy": 1, "Internet": 1, "Intellectual_property": 1, "Collective_action": 1, "Market_failure": 1, "Public_good": 1, "Scientific_method": 1, "Internet_Relay_Chat": 1, "Open-source_software_development": 1}, "wordcount": {"as_well": 1, "propose": 1, "shared": 1, "problems": 1, "this_paper": 1, "models": 2, "projects": 1, "society": 1, "selling": 1, "scholars": 1, "efficient": 1, "in_order": 2, "returns": 2, "software": 4, "data": 1, "describe": 1, "innovations": 1, "result": 1, "users": 1, "development": 3, "details": 1, "collective_action": 2, "raises": 1, "new": 1, "elements": 1, "conducting": 1, "without": 1, "also": 1, "private": 5, "investment": 2, "model": 4, "assumes": 2, "best": 1, "collective": 1, "produce": 1, "regimes": 1, "market_failure": 1, "technical": 1, "goods": 1, "prevalent": 1, "ease": 1, "innovators": 1, "offer": 3, "empirical_studies": 1, "two": 1, "open_source": 4, "protection": 1, "researchers": 1, "regarding": 1, "contains": 1, "phenomenon": 1, "conditions": 1, "types": 1, "set": 1, "advice": 1, "science": 2, "reveal": 1, "access": 1, "shows_that": 1, "intellectual_property": 1, "many": 1, "processes": 1, "organization": 2, "available": 1, "innovation": 2}, "plain_text_proposition": "* There are many interesting puzzles in open source software research projects that can trigger the interest of organization scholars for years to come.

Important information was collected also about the experiences as well as concrete costs involved in the rights clearance processes of cultural institutions. This information shows that rights clearance is costly and cumbersome for these institutions. In fact, the amount of time and effort to obtain licenses to digitise works has overwhelmed many of them.

In the recently released Communications \\\"Europeana \u2013 next steps\\\"  and \\\"Copyright in the knowledge economy\\\"  the Commission indicates that it will examine the orphan works problem in an impact assessment, which will explore a variety of approaches to facilitate the digitisation and dissemination of such works.\n\nIt is hard to establish reliable figures on the amount of orphan works, because at the moment there is no easy way to establish that a work is orphan. Hence, very little systematic research has been done and hardly any empirical data has been available about problems related to orphan works. The orphan works issue has been extensively analysed by the Copyright Subgroup within the High Level Expert Group on Digital Libraries, appointed by the Commission in 2006. A consolidated Final Report was published in December 2009.\n\nTherefore, as a complement to the past work and in order to gather as much empirical evidence as possible on orphan works in terms of 1) the dimension of the problem and 2) of the time and resources involved in efforts for clearing rights, the Commission carried out a fact finding mission in December 2009. A request for information was sent to 17 representatives of cultural institutions who had previously been involved with digitisation of cultural materials (such as British Library, Institut National de l'Audiovisuel and Deutsche Nationalbibliothek). The letter was also distributed via mailing lists of library organisations such as the LIBER and CENL. Attached to this assessment is a list of the recipients. All together the Commission received 22 responses. Several of them included comprehensive tables and statistics about key issues reflecting the above questions and a description of concrete situations. Considering the difficulties in demonstrating the dimension of orphan works in concrete figures within digitisation projects around Europe, the received materials have been useful to illustrate the difficulties faced by cultural institutions when trying to clear the rights involved in the digitisation and online accessibility of protected content in their collections, particularly orphan works.\n\nThis analysis gathers the experiences of this fact finding mission as well as the figures included in other governmental fact finding initiatives, such as the US Report on Orphan Works and the Gower's Review, both of 2006, and the more recent Digital Britain, \u00a9 The way ahead and In from the Cold reports, all of 2009. The results of the ACE Study (European Film Archives association) of 2010 about the amount of orphan works in film archives across Europe is also reflected in this paper. The status of national initiatives regarding solutions to the orphan works issue in various Member States was examined in February 2008. Some EU countries had already taken steps to develop a specific solution for the orphan works issue. The most advanced in this area are Denmark and Hungary. Denmark had chosen to strengthen their system of extended collective licences widely applied also in the rest of the Nordic countries, while Hungary opted for a centrally-granted non-exclusive licence solution. In addition, several Member States such as the UK, Germany and France are considering solutions varying from limitations to the exclusive rights of the authors, to the use of mandatory collective licensing, or so called extended collective licensing.\nIn order to solve this issue in a coherent way for all the EU, steps to propose legislation in this field need to be taken urgently.", "entities": ["Knowledge_economy", "Orphan_works", "Nazi_Germany", "Digital_Britain", "John_Gower", "National_library", "Hungary", "German_National_Library", "British_Library", "Europeana", "France", "Great_Britain", "Empirical_research", "Nordic_countries", "Extended_collective_licensing", "Digital_library", "European_Union", "Advanced_Composition_Explorer", "Institut_national_de_l'audiovisuel", "Denmark"], "country": ["Austria", "Belgium", "Bulgaria", "Croatia", "Cyprus", "Czech Republic", "Denmark", "Estonia", "Finland", "France", "Germany", "Greece", "Hungary", "Ireland", "Italy", "Latvia", "Lithuania", "Luxembourg", "Malta", "Netherlands", "Poland", "Portugal", "Romania", "Slovakia", "Slovenia", "Spain", "Sweden", "United Kingdom"], "authentic_link": "http://www.ace-film.eu/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/Copyright_anna_report-1.pdf", "citation_count": 3.0, "literature_review": 0, "industries": ["Publishing of books, periodicals and other publishing", "Photographic activities", "Cultural education"], "disciplines": ["Technological Change: Choices and Consequences \u2022 Diffusion Processes", "Intellectual Property and Intellectual Capital", "Government Policy"], "year": 2010.0, "label": "Assessment of the Orphan works issue and Costs for Rights Clearance.

Once it is captured, then if the work is of a recognized kind, it will be accorded copyright protection. \n* A performer, on the other hand, is recognized as a performer in the absence of a performance being fixed. The lower parameters of the right accorded to performers, both unfixed and once fixed, which protects only the fixation itself and not the underlying performance against copying, seems much more suited to music and dance subcultures than does copyright with its expansive property right.

The overwhelming majority had \u2018portfolio careers\u2019. In other words, they could not live by their art alone, but rather had to seek out other income streams. These included commercial work for third parties and, rather often, teaching.

Through a series of interviews with musicians, singers, songwriters, composers, dancers, choreographers and others involved in the music industry and dance community we came to the conclusion that these types of works are both before copyright and beyond copyright. They are before copyright because what matters to the majority of those involved is the process of creation \u2013 which itself is constantly evolving \u2013 rather than the product \u2013 the protected work once fixed. They are beyond copyright because key aspects of the performance involve contributions which are not recognised by copyright, and because there is much about the performance which simply cannot be captured in the mechanical sense.

More free riders in number make it more likely for a sharer to keep sharing, while more free rider activities discourage sharers from contributing.

I examine the impact of digital rights management (DRM) - a prevalent strategy used by firms in media industries to address piracy concerns - on music sales. I exploit a natural experiment, where different labels remove DRM from their entire catalogue of music at different times, to examine whether relaxing an album's sharing restrictions increases sales. Using a large sample of albums from all four major record labels, I find that removing DRM increases digital music sales by 10% but relaxing sharing restrictions does not impact all albums equally. It increases the sales of lower-selling albums (i.e., the \\\"long tail\\\") significantly (30%) but does not benefit top-selling albums.

One of the important factors to consider in policy formulation is the financial interests in database contents. A creator who invested in creating a database is interested in recouping the investment using the revenues that the database helps to generate. The revenues may be reduced when a free-riding reuser creates a competing database by extracting the contents from the creator's database. Thus, creators would like to have certain means of protecting the contents in their databases. Without adequate protection, the incentives of creating  such databases could diminish. On the other hand, overprotection can cause under-utilization of information and make downstream value-added data reuse costly or even impossible.

We address this issue using an extended spatial competition model that explicitly considers licensing provisions and inefficiencies in policy administration.
