The Business Software Alliance (BSA) and International Data Corporation (IDC) estimated that worldwide software piracy rate went up to 41 percent in 2008 and worldwide losses to software vendors due to software piracy totaled more than $50 billion in 2008 (BSA and IDC, 2009). Besides being an economic problem, software piracy is also an ethical issue, especially in academic settings. The evidences from numerous studies suggest that many undergraduate students consider software piracy and other unethical use of information technologies as an acceptable behavior.\n\nThe main purpose of the present study is to investigate the relationships between the demographic characteristics of freshman students and their attitudes towards software piracy. Data were obtained from a survey sample of 125 students in the Department of Business Administration at a public university in Turkey. The study found that overall attitudes of freshman students towards software piracy are close to neutral position on the Likert scale. The results of the regression analysis showed that monthly family income and duration of Internet usage in a week affected attitudes of freshman students towards software piracy, but to a lower extent.','*Overall attitudes of freshman students towards software piracy are close to neutral position on the Likert scale\n\n*The majority of the participants do not have a strong opinion about software piracy either way.\n\n*Attitudes of freshman students towards software piracy were affected by monthly family income and duration of Internet usage in a week, but to a lower extent.\n\n* Unexpectedly, it was found that there is a positive relationship between monthly family income and software piracy attitude.','In order to minimize software piracy among university students, proactive steps should be taken. Education is one of the most common recommendations in the literature for preventing software piracy and raising awareness of software piracy among students. Education on ethical topics and information technology use should include ethical use of information technologies and software in the curriculum and should be supported by the real case studies. Giving examples of arrested software pirates in the lectures might create a deeper awareness of the seriousness of the consequences of software piracy. \nA clearly stated information technology usage policy should be adopted by the universities.

The Swedish implementation of the European Union directive IPRED on April 1, 2009 suddenly increased the risk of being caught and prosecuted for file sharing. We investigate the subsequent drop in piracy as approximated by the drop in Swedish Internet traffic and the effects on music and movie sales in Sweden. We find that the reform decreased Internet traffic by 18 percent during the subsequent six months. It also increased sales of physical music by 27 percent and digital music by 48 percent. Furthermore, it had no significant effects on the sales of theater tickets or DVD movies. The results indicate that pirated music is a strong substitute for legal music whereas the substitutability is less for movies.','This article empirically investigates the effects of copyright protection reform on Internet piracy and on sales of music and movies. More specifically, This article argues that: \n\n*The Swedish implementation of the IPRED law on April 1, 2009 suddenly increased the risks of piracy. Piracy decreased and that music sales increased after the law reform.\n\n*Pirated music is a strong substitute to legal music, whereas the substitutability is less for movies. After six months, piracy recovered to a large extent, which resulted in a decrease in the demand for legal music and decreased physical as well as total sales.\n\n*This raises some doubts regarding the effectiveness of such law reforms in the long run, but it also points towards better legal alternatives to piracy as a possible way forward for the music industry.','- Law reform can be effective in preventing piracy and in increasing music sales for the first six months. Some of these effects must be attributed to a combination of the law and widespread public interest.\n- It is possible that convictions would restore an effect that is more long-lasting.','http://econpapers.repec.org/paper/hhsiuiwop/0854.htm','http://econpapers.repec.org/paper/hhsiuiwop/0854.htm',1,0,1,'Weekly and quarterly data taken from aggregate Internet traffic through Internet Exchange Points (IXPs).'),('Aguiar_and_Martens_(2013)','Aguiar and Martens (2013)','http://www.copyrightevidence.org/evidence-wiki/index.php/Aguiar_and_Martens_(2013)',NULL,'Digital Music Consumption on the Internet: Evidence from Clickstream Data','The goal of this paper is to analyze the behavior of digital music consumers on the Internet. Using clickstream data on a panel of more than 16,000 European consumers, we estimate the effects of illegal downloading and legal streaming on the legal purchases of digital music. Our results suggest that Internet users do not view illegal downloading as a substitute to legal digital music. Although positive and significant, our estimated elasticities are essentially zero: a 10% increase in clicks on illegal downloading websites leads to a 0.2% increase in clicks on legal purchases websites. Online music streaming services are found to have a somewhat larger (but still small) effect on the purchases of digital sound recordings, suggesting complementarities between these two modes of music consumption. According to our results, a 10% increase in clicks on legal streaming websites lead to up to a 0.7% increase in clicks on legal digital purchases websites. We find important cross country difference in these effects.','* Illegal music downloads have little or no effect on legal digital sales; although there is trespassing of private property rights (copyrights), there is unlikely to be much harm done on digital music revenues.\n\n* The above assertion must be interpreted in the context of a still evolving music industry. It is important to note that music consumption in physical format has until recently accounted for the lion\'s share of total music revenues. If piracy leads to substantial sales displacement of music in physical format, then its effect on the overall music industry revenues may well still be negative.\n\n* The effect of online music streaming on the legal purchases of digital music suggests complementarity between streaming services and purchases of legal digital music.

Despite substantial growth in availability, choice sets have not converged across countries; and observers point to copyright-related transaction costs as an obstacle to greater availability. Policy makers are now contemplating various copyright reforms that could reduce these trade costs. The possibility of these changes raises the question of how much benefit they would create for consumers and producers around the world. We address these questions with a structural model of supply and demand for music in 17 countries, which we employ to counterfactually simulate the effect of a European digital single market (the equivalent of a pan-European copyright regime) on the welfare of consumers and producers. We also simulate autarky and worldwide frictionless trade - in which all products are available in all countries - allowing us to quantify both the conventional gains from status quo trade as well as the maximum possible gains available to free trade. Existing and additional trade have different patterns of benefit to consumers and producers. Status quo trade benefits consumers everywhere, but European consumers have benefited more than North Americans. Existing trade has had large benefits to American producers but on balance small benefits to European producers. Additional trade would continue the pattern of consumers benefits with larger gains to European consumers but would reverse the pattern for producers. Greater availability of products resulting from easing of copyright restrictions would raise per capita gains to producers in Europe more than in North America. Finally, we find that a European single market would bring most of the benefits of worldwide frictionless trade to both consumers and producers alike.','Moving from the current status quo to an EU Digital Single Market for music would increase consumer surplus from digital music consumption by 1.8 per cent (€19 million) and music producers\' revenue by 1.1 per cent (€10 million). Benefits vary considerably across Member States. Under worldwide frictionless trade consumers in 15 European countries gain €31 million (a 3% increase) while North American consumers gain €6.5 million (a 0.35% increase). Most of the gains from fully frictionless trade - about two thirds - are accomplished by a European single market. Annual gains from worldwide frictionless trade for producers, compared to autarky, reach 1.9% in Europe and 0.38% in the US. Clearly, the additional gains from moving beyond a European Digital Single Market to a worldwide open market would be small for European producers and consumers. Digital music production and consumption is only a small part of all media markets covered by copyright. We note that the figures presented here represent only a fraction of the potential benefits from further trade opening in other digital media.','* Copyright transaction costs can serve as a barrier to the trading of goods.\n* The disproportionate amount of digital music imported by EU nations from the US (and other English speaking nations Canada and the UK) lead to a cultural disadvantage further hampered by copyright transaction costs between member states.','http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2603238','http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2603238',0,0,0,'This study uses reports of sales of digital music from Nielsen and IFPI from 2006 to 2011.

Copyright is frequently noted as a significant obstacle to these efforts, but little empirical data exist on the copyright permissions process in archives. This article reports the findings of a study of the copyright permissions process for the Jon Cohen AIDS Research Collection at the University of Michigan. Specifically, the study sought to reveal how much effort is required to seek copyright permissions, what the results of those efforts would be, and whether or not there were traits of documents or copyright holders that were associated with accept or denial status. The study found that significant time is required to contact and negotiate with rights holders and that the biggest obstacle to getting permission is non-response. Of those requests that get a response, the vast majority are to grant permission. While few of the requests were met with denial, the data suggest that commercial copyright holders are much more likely to deny permission than other types of copyright holders. The data also show that adherence to the common policy of only displaying online those documents with explicit permission will likely result in substantially incomplete online collections.','* While most of the copyrighted items (96%, 5,262) in the Cohen collection had just one copyright holder, a small portion had between two and ten copyright holders. Items with multiple rights holders would generally take considerably more time to obtain permissions for than items with just one rights holder\n\n* The mean response time from staff’s initial permissions request until resolution (where resolution is defined as some answer from the rights holder), was 41 days \n\n* Commercial copyright holders were found to have a significantly higher mean response time than individual copyright holders\n\n* Refuse permission for all responses were found to have a significantly higher mean response time than grant permission to all responses. In addition, grant permission for some responses also had a significantly higher mean response time than grant permission to all responses\n\n* Approximately 120 days after the initial request, there are diminishing returns, no matter the type of copyright holder. That is, the percentage that survive (i.e. do not respond) stays level for all types of copyright holders after a period of approximately 120 days.\n\n*  Most often those responses were to grant permission to all. Of all of the responses from rights holders, 679 (91%) were to grant the Library permission to display all items requested in permissions letters. Only 46 (6%) of the responses were refuse all. In fact, the biggest obstacle to displaying materials online was non-response: 352 (32%) of all of the Cohen Project permissions requests were met with non-response.\n\n*  The Library ultimately had permission to display online 3,490 (64%) of the copyrighted items in the collection. Unfortunately, 981 (18%) of the copyright items in the collection could not be displayed due to non-response from rights holders. Another 687 (13%) could not be displayed for three main reasons: staff could not identify the rights holder (22); staff could not locate the rights holder (309); or the rights holder was a company that they found to be defunct (356). Only 294 (5%) of the copyrighted items in the Cohen Collection were explicitly denied.','* Archives must reconsider the appropriateness of a policy that equates non-response with denial. There is a certain cost to restricting oneself to only posting materials with a definitive “granted permission” response, even after a significant amount of effort has gone into requesting permission from the rights holder. \n\n* Which copyright-related factors should archives consider when evaluating whether or not to digitize a particular collection for online, open access? As shown by this and other projects, cost is a major factor in mass digitization efforts, and the Cohen data demonstrate that tasks related to copyright permissions account for a significant portion of staff time. \n\n* The Cohen Project benefitted greatly from a dedicated source of funding\n\n*  A large number of requests (32%) were met with non-response.

Software piracy behavior has been investigated for more than 30 years. However, after a review of the relevant literature, there appears to be two voids in this literature: a lack of studies in non-Western countries and a scarcity of process studies. This study contributes to literature by developing a software piracy model to better understand the decision-making process that underlies this unethical behavior. The model was tested using data collected from a sample of 323 undergraduate business students. Consistent with the Theory of Reasoned Action (TRA), attitudes toward software piracy and subjective norms were significant predictors of intention to pirate software. Also, the results suggested that ethical ideology, public self-consciousness, and low self-control moderated the effect of these variables on intention to pirate software. The results have important practical implications for the software industry and governments hoping to curtail software piracy.

TRA posits that the most immediate precursor of behaviour is an individual’s intention to behave, which in turn is determined by attitude toward a target behaviour and subjective norms. Subjective norms are perceived social pressures exerted on an individual to perform a behaviour or not. The results of the study were as follows:\n\n* TRA was a useful theoretical framework to predict Jordanian university students’ intentions to engage in software piracy and explained variance in the individual’s intention to pirate software;\n\n* Relative to attitude, subjective norms had a stronger effect on intention to pirate software;\n\n* The influence of perceived subjective norms on intention to pirate software was about twice as great as that of attitude toward software piracy;\n\n* The stronger effect of subjective norms in shaping Jordanian university students intention to pirate software relative to their attitudes might be attributed to the collectivistic nature of the Jordan culture;\n\n* The effect of students’ attitude on their intention to pirate software was significantly moderated by ethical ideology (idealism and relativism);\n\n* The presence of low self-control enhanced the effect of subjective norms on behavioral intention. This suggests that low self-control students had stronger intentions to pirate software when they perceived that significant others were supportive of or engaged in such behaviour and vice versa;\n\n* High public self- consciousness students were more attuned to significant others’ demands and opinions than students with low public self-consciousness; thus, their intentions to pirate software were determined more by their perception of subjective norms;\n\n* Religiosity had insignificant moderating effect on the software piracy attitude– intention relationship;\n\n* Subjective norms did not affect all students equally; subjective norms had a stronger effect on students who scored higher on low self-control and public self-consciousness scales;\n\n* The effect of attitude on intention to pirate software was significantly moderated by ethical ideology.','The results of the study enhance understanding of software piracy and enable the provision of recommendations to curtail this unethical act in developing countries.

However, the results did indicate that attitude, subjective norms, and perceived behavioural control each accounted for significant variance in P2P file downloading behaviour, and that these relationships were fully mediated by behavioural intent.

The behavioral incentives underpinning free music downloading, novel to this paper, are the multiple effects of: ‘unwillingness to pay’ (market substitution), ‘hear before buying’ (market creation), ‘not wanting to buy a whole album’ (market segmentation), and ‘not available in the CD format or on electronic pay-sites’ (market creation). Although the two first mentioned incentives significantly influence CD album purchases—i.e. there is a negative and significant market substitution effect and a positive and significant market creation effect—on the whole, these two effects ‘cancel’ one another out, leading to no association between the number of P2P files downloaded and CD album sales.','Tested 3 hypothesis:\n# There is a negative relationship between the perceived price of CD albums and number of CD albums bought.\n# There is a negative relationship between ‘free music downloads and P2P file-sharing’ and CD sale.

However, close examination of the EU Term Directive’s intricate provisions reveals a piecemeal and permissive approach to harmonisation which preserves many differences between the national rules. In this report, four main sources of legislative variability are identified and analysed: a) contagion from unharmonised areas of substantive copyright law; b) explicit exceptions to the harmonisation of the term of protection; c) national related rights of unharmonised term; and d) incorrect implementation of the provisions of the Term Directive into national law. As a result, the desired harmonising effect has not been fully achieved: although a single rule may be applicable across the EU in theory, drastically divergent terms of protection may attach to the same information product depending on the jurisdiction within which protection is sought. In this way, the territorial nature of copyright undercuts harmonisation efforts, forcing the public domain to contract and expand according to divergent national rules. The result is a legislative framework that makes cross-border rights clearance calculation difficult, hampering end-users and cultural heritage organisations from taking full avail of the new opportunities now technically available for the digitisation and exploitation of the public domain. If the EU wishes to establish a truly harmonised term of protection for copyright and related rights, a more committed and comprehensive approach will be a necessary.','*Despite the Term Directive’s attempt to establish a harmonised term of protection for works of copyright and related rights across the EU, unharmonised pockets in term of protection legislation persist. Four main sources of legislative variability can be identified: a) contagion from unharmonised areas of substantive copyright law; b) explicit exceptions to the harmonisation of the term of protection; c) national related rights of unharmonised term; and d) incorrect implementation of the provisions of the Term Directive into national law. National duration idiosyncrasies thus survive into the post-harmonisation era – a single European term of protection remains very much a chimera.  \n\n*Without proper EU harmonisation of the term of protection the same subject matter might receive a drastically different term of protection depending on the country within which protection is sought, increasing the complexity of the calculation of the duration of copyright and related rights in Europe 27 times over. This fragmented state of affairs is maladjusted to the challenges of the digital world: although from a legal point of view the public domain may still be conceived of as multiple separate country-specific entities, with the advent of online exploitation the use of a work is envisaged as taking place simultaneously across borders.61 Territoriality, a cornerstone of traditional copyright law, does not tally with the look and feel of the internet.\n\n*Diverse national rules make the calculation of the term of protection excessively difficult. European cross-border digitisation projects such as Europeana may wish to signal the public domain status of holdings to their users, but which is the relevant public domain? If a work has no set copyright status, marking it online as definitively free to use becomes treacherous. Cultural institutions are likely to follow the term of protection rules of their own country, but this will not provide legal certainty for users situated elsewhere.','The author points out that if the public domain is to be fully and freely digitised and exploited legal certainly must be provided as to exactly which cultural creations fall within its confines and which are still protected by proprietary rights. The semi-harmonisation achieved thus far has narrowed the autonomy of Member States in the area of the term of protection, providing some superficial approximation. The devil of disharmonisation however persists in the details of term harmonisation. If the EU wishes to establish a truly harmonised term of protection for copyright and related rights, a more committed and comprehensive approach will be a necessary. Some of the identified harmonisation gaps can be filled with a stricter European harmonisation policy intolerant of national oddities. Others, such as those caused by transitional provisions or international obligations granting terms of protection longer than those foreseen in the Directive, will not be eliminated for decades. However, disparities in the conceptual framework of copyright can only be overcome with the harmonisation of European substantive copyright law. In its recent Communication on a Single Market for Intellectual Property Rights the Commission broached the idea of a far-reaching overhaul of copyright at the European level through the creation of a European Copyright Code. Challenging as the execution of this proposal might be politically, such a code would go a long way to ensuring legal certainty for European citizens.','http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2145862','http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2145862',1,0,1,'The author makes a comparative analysis of the terms of protection of copyright and related rights between six different legal systems.'),('Arai_and_Kinukawa_(2014)','Arai and Kinukawa (2014)','http://www.copyrightevidence.org/evidence-wiki/index.php/Arai_and_Kinukawa_(2014)',2014,'Copyright infringement as user innovation','Copyright holders of major manga and anime in Japan have been ignoring copyright infringement by dojinshi  (or doujinshi), a Japanese word referring to self-published works created predominately by amateurs.

Thus, it is highly possible that the activity of\ndojinshi  creators violates Article 28 of the Copyright Law of Japan, which states the rights of original authors in the situation of exploitation by derivative works. We demonstrate that ignoring copyright infringement by a derivative creator can be optimal for the copyright holder based on an economic model that incorporates both positive and negative externalities of derivative work.

Legal action is only taken when a third violation is detected. We analyze the impact of this law on individual behavior.

While in recent years distinct aspects of the problem have been addressed by legislatures and courts, both at the national and at the European level, a great deal of legal uncertainty persists. Divergent views on the appropriateness, form and scope of such legal protection exist among stakeholders and other concerned parties, reflecting the complex nature and multiple functions of sports in modern society. The universe of sports and media is a complex network of social and commercial relationships with a variety of stakeholders, each one of whom can claim rights or specific interests in the value chain of organizing and exploiting sports events, such as clubs, leagues, athletes, federations, fans, media content providers, sponsors, owners of sport facilities, sports betting operators and news media.  \n\nConsequently, the question of protecting sports events is by no means a one-dimensional legal issue, and should be framed in a broader socio-economic context. On the one hand, professional sport represents a large and fast-growing sector of the European economy – and in no small measure this is due to the commercial significance of sports media rights. On the other hand, sports are widely regarded as playing a pivotal role as a “social cohesive”, an agent of communal, and conveyor of moral, values. This helps explain why major sports events qualify in various Member States as “events of major importance” for society, subject to special media rules mitigating exclusive rights of broadcasters to guarantee viewers’ access to these events via free-to-air television.  \n\nThe general objective of this study is to examine and critically assess a number of the most pressing questions of substantive law relating to the existence and exercise of sports organisers\' rights in the EU. The specific objectives of the study are:  \n To map the legal framework applicable to the origin and ownership of sports organisers\' rights in the 28 Member States;  To analyse the nature and scope of sports organisers\' rights with regard to licensing practices in the field of the media, taking into account relevant EU law provisions;  To examine the possibility of establishing licensing practices beyond the media field, notably in the area of gambling and betting;  To provide recommendations on the opportunity of EU action to address any problem that may be identified in the above mentioned areas of analysis.','* The rights and interests of sports organisers are generally well safeguarded at the substantive legal level. The “house right” gives sports events organisers and clubs (and indirectly the sports federations) a right to exclude unauthorized media from the venue, and thereby creates leverage for the event organisers to negotiate exclusive contracts regarding media coverage. In practice, these contracts may or may not provide for complete or partial transfer(s) to the sports organisers of the copyrights and neighbouring rights in the audiovisual recording and transmission of the event. Sports events organisers or their federations may, alternatively, elect to produce and distribute media coverage of the sports events themselves. Either way, the combination of house right, media contract(s), and intellectual property protection of the audiovisual recording and broadcast effectively allows the sports event organisers to enjoy complete ownership and/or control over the audiovisual rights in the sports events.   \n\n* The integrity and financial benefits of a right to consent to bets can only be fully achieved when it is carefully managed by a national regulatory authority that:  \n1. actively prosecutes illegal betting services (including the offering of sports bets by licensed operators without the sports organisers’ consent); 2. monitors the commercial exploitation of the right to consent to bets to prevent discriminatory or anti-competitive marketing conditions; 3. provides for an ex post mechanism for complaint handling and dispute resolution; 4. has the power to conduct on-going monitoring of the parties’ compliance with the mutual rights and obligations contained in the contractual agreements. \n\n* The right of short news reporting is an important element of the EU legal order safeguarding the right of broadcasters to have access to “events of high interest to the public”, such as important sports events, which are subject to exclusive broadcasting rights. However, the way this right is currently framed, allowing Member States the option of either mandating access to the transmitting broadcaster’s signals, or requiring direct access to the venue where the event takes place, has resulted in some differences in implementation by the Member States (i.e. on the duration of the short news reporting).   \n\n* The comparative analysis of EU and national decisional practice reveals that for the most part the NCAs have replicated the heavy-handed remedy package designed by the European Commission. The “no single buyer” obligation, a remedy that was exceptionally imposed by the Commission in FAPL, is increasingly being emulated at the national level. Only with regard to the duration of exclusivity, more and more NCAs are demonstrating a readiness for a more flexible approach (i.e. by accepting exclusive rights contracts exceeding three years).','The EU should encourage Member States to address the generally observed lack of legal certainty as regards sports sponsorship by gambling operators in the context of their national gambling advertising regulations.  It is recommended that sponsorship-related issues are included in the European Commission’s upcoming “Recommendation on responsible gambling advertising”. Other additional courses of action ought to be considered, in particular to facilitate enforcement co-operation between different national regulatory authorities concerning cross-border advertising of unauthorized gambling services.  \n\nRegarding cross-border sports events, further attention should be paid to the use of technological tools that may offer pragmatic solutions (e.g. virtual advertising). In any event, organisers of such events must respect national legislations. In case they induce participants in their events to infringe national gambling advertising and/or breach personal sponsorship contracts, they should arguably be found liable and not the participant that is faced with a dilemma: respect the regulations of the sports organiser (that typically require participants to comply with the organisers’ sponsorship arrangements) or respect national regulations and personal sponsorship contracts with the risk of being eliminated from the competition.','http://ec.europa.eu/sport/news/2014/docs/study-sor2014-final-report-gc-compatible_en.pdf','http://ec.europa.eu/sport/news/2014/docs/study-sor2014-final-report-gc-compatible_en.pdf',0,0,0,'This study combines traditional legal research methods (desk research, literature review, document analysis), with an approach based on “field work” and data collection (qualitative analysis).

The main issues discussed are the impact of selection on access, the preservation of original material and digital objects, and the financial issues surrounding digitization projects. The article does not deal with the technical aspects of digitization. A questionnaire survey was conducted of 20 UK public libraries and archives to determine their experiences related to the above issues. It was found that few digitization projects realized their full potential in terms of preserving original material, and so little has been done to ensure the preservation of the digitized material. Although access is significantly increased, the range of material that has been digitized is very narrow and is driven largely by copyright restrictions rather than user demand. The survey also highlighted the disparity between funding for access to a very small portion of library holdings through digitization, and the funding of traditional preservation for the remainder of collections.','The opinion amongst those surveyed is very much that funding sources for digitization and for preservation are distinctly separate, and therefore one does not affect the other.\nHowever comments made by the respondents verified that tensions do exist over the levels of funding available for each activity. The survey highlighted just how little is spent on\npreservation in many libraries and archives and that typically preservation needs are seen as much larger than budgets can cater for.\nAlthough the data on financial issues was far from comprehensive, this in itself tends to indicate a general lack of awareness concerning project costs. However, having allowed for the incomplete nature of the data, two points are tentatively made. The impact of major grant\nfunding has been to virtually halt digitization projects in public libraries and archives during the last two years, and the majority of digitization projects have generated no significant\nrevenue.\nThe widespread promotion of preservation (after access) as a major benefit following digitization does not appear to be widely supported by the subsequent actions in public libraries and archives. The two ways in which digitization is said to improve preservation, a fall in demand\nto see original material and the imposition of access restrictions, have not been universally seen or adopted.\nThe level of awareness that libraries and archives in general have concerning the problems of digital preservation, must have risen to some degree given their exposure to the standards in the nof-digitise programme. However, libraries and archives have been slow to adopt preservation\npolicies and none of those surveyed include digitization in their policy.\nThere is also a distinct lack of urgency in considering migration as a strategy for digital preservation. The comments of respondents indicated that this was more likely to be an issue for the IT department to consider, although the majority of libraries and archives claimed sole responsibility for the preservation of digital master files.','Digitization projects are complex and need to be managed carefully to ensure resources are not wasted. Libraries and archives must budget for the whole life cycle of the digitization process and not just for image capture.\nThe survey has shown that following digitization, demand for access to original material does not necessarily\ndecline. Libraries and archives should consider automatically placing restrictions on access to original materials where appropriate. This would improve preservation at little cost to the beleaguered budgets identified by many respondents, and would be consistent with using preservation as a selection criterion.\nUntil a formal preservation policy is in place, any attempt to raise significant funding for preservation activities is unlikely to succeed. Having a preservation policy is now a common requisite for the consideration of applications by funding bodies.\nDigitization should be included in that policy, even if no projects are currently planned. It will help increase awareness of digital preservation issues and will highlight the preservation aspects of digitization, rather than those that exclusively concern access.\nResearch is needed into how strategies for acquiring and preserving digital material can be developed specifically for the public library sector as a whole. Without this it is likely that strategy development will be slow and unco-ordinated.\nThere is also a need for research into robust models of the costs of digitization that take into account preservation issues.','http://www.msu.ac.zw/elearning/material/1159209117Dig.%20%26%20pres.%20libs.%20%26%20archs.%202002.pdf','http://lis.sagepub.com/content/34/2/67.short',0,0,0,'The study takes data from 24 cultural heritage institutions.'),('Attorney-General\'s_Department_(2008)','Attorney-General\'s Department (2008)','http://www.copyrightevidence.org/evidence-wiki/index.php/Attorney-General\'s_Department_(2008)',2008,'Copyright Exceptions for Private Copying of Photographs and Films: Review of Sections 47J and 110AA','The Attorney-General’s Department has carried out a review of the operation of two copyright exceptions that permit ‘format-shifting’. These exceptions are sections 47J and 110AA of the Copyright Act 1968 which permit photographs and cinematograph films to be reproduced in a different format for private use, subject to certain conditions.  The review included a call for interested party submissions and intergovernmental agency consultations.\nCopyright is a form of intellectual property that protects the rights of creators in certain original forms of expression, including photographs and cinematograph films. It rewards creative effort, and economic investment in creative effort, by granting a number of exclusive economic rights. These rights provide an incentive to encourage the generation and flow of new material to the public. One of the core rights granted by copyright is the right to prevent other persons from copying a work. While copyright does not guarantee a proportionate return for the work involved, the ability to require other persons to pay for copying can give creators and investors some security for the skill, time and resources necessary to produce new works.\nThe Act also provides many exceptions which limit the scope of copyright. These exceptions are an integral part of copyright, recognising that in some circumstances the usual rights of copyright owners should not apply. Exceptions may be adopted for various reasons; such as to permit incidental uses that do not cause significant harm to copyright owners or because a particular limitation of copyright serves the broader public interest. The nature and scope of exceptions reflect decisions by Parliament on balancing public and private interests.','* Recommendation 1: The Department recommends a re-examination of public awareness material and consumer information on the meaning of the format-shifting exceptions to assist people to understand their rights and obligations under the Copyright Act 1968.\n\n* Recommendation 2: The Department recommends that no change be made to section 47J at this time. However it would be beneficial to provide further public information in relation to copyright in photographs taken professionally for a family or private occasion.\n\n* Recommendation 3: The Department recommends that no change be made to section 110AA at this time. However, the Department will continue to monitor the evolution of relevant markets to determine if new products are introduced as anticipated by the film industry.','The Department recommended no statutory changes at the time of the Report other than increased public information and education.','http://apo.org.au/files/Resource/copyrightexceptionsforprivatecopyingofphotographsandfilmsreviewofsections47jand110aaofthecopyrightact1968.pdf','http://apo.org.au/files/Resource/copyrightexceptionsforprivatecopyingofphotographsandfilmsreviewofsections47jand110aaofthecopyrightact1968.pdf',0,0,0,'33 submissions from interested parties, including individuals and organisations as well as intergovernmental agency consultation.'),('Aufderheide_and_Jaszi_(2004)','Aufderheide and Jaszi (2004)','http://www.copyrightevidence.org/evidence-wiki/index.php/Aufderheide_and_Jaszi_(2004)',2004,'Untold Stories: Creative Consequences of the Rights Clearance Culture for Documentary Filmmakers','This study explores the implications of the rights clearance process on documentary film making, and makes recommendations to lower costs, reduce frustration, and promote creativity.

It assesses the changes in documentary production practice around clearance of copyrighted material since the creation of the Documentary Filmmakers’ Statement of Best Practices in fair use in 2005. Fair use, an exotic and occasional feature of documentary film in 2004, has become well-known and commonly employed. Creative options for filmmakers concerning use of third-party material have dramatically improved with changes in norms after the issuing of the Statement. Attitudes about fair use are strongly associated with free expression and creative opportunity, and vary with experience. Where filmmakers have changed work because of copyright concerns, they themselves rather than any gatekeeper have made the decision to do so. Where change is associated with fair use, risk is a common concern. Newer filmmakers are more likely to support use of copyrighted material to make new work, but less likely to know about fair use, and also more likely to have experienced takedowns online. Both education about and experience with fair use appear to have an effect on practice. Filmmakers continue to lack reliable information on the actual risk landscape, and about fair use on digital platforms.','Main results of the study: \n\n*In terms of documentary film-making, increased awareness of group expectations has changed the way that copyright law is used, and thus the utility of the law, and clarity regarding best practices has increased institutional support for creators. \n\n*The use of the Best Practices statement and related activities has transformed employment of fair use into common industry practice.\n\n*Documentary filmmakers’ understanding of and employment of fair use shows a remarkable shift from 2004, when a qualitative study showed widespread uncertainty and when fair use claims were a rare exception rather than a routine feature of filmmaking.\n\n*Today’s filmmakers overwhelmingly perceive fair use as an aid to free expression, and furthermore an aid to expression that does not harm their own ability to use copyright monopoly rights. \n\n*They routinely expect to accompany fair use with credit to third-party creators, which they view as a primary ethical obligation. \n\n*Their knowledge of and confidence in fair use is broader even than their familiarity with the Documentary Filmmakers’ Statement of Fair Use, which suggests that the professional values articulated in the document have been widely internalized in industry practice.\n\n*Many filmmakers have paid for and requested permission to use work when they did not believe they should have to, under fair use, and most of them have changed final product because of copyright concerns. \n\n*Concerns about legal and economic risk appear to be the chief reason filmmakers overlook their own fair use rights, and have come more from the filmmakers themselves than from their gatekeepers. \n\n*These concerns appear to be associated not with any confusion about the legitimacy of their fair use decisions but a lack of awareness of the widespread acceptance of fair use among peers, collaborators and gatekeepers.','Policy implications:\n\n*Early-career filmmakers could improve their creative opportunities by better understanding their fair use options. \n\n*More experienced filmmakers could improve their creative opportunities by better understanding open licenses and digital production and distribution platforms.\n\n*The profound shift in industry practice demonstrates the power of creative consensus around application of the law to change practice at the creative, business and legal levels.','http://dx.doi.org/10.2139/ssrn.2603400','http://dx.doi.org/10.2139/ssrn.2603400',0,0,0,'Online survey of documentary filmmakers, with 489 responses.'),('Australian_Law_Reform_Commission_(2013)','Australian Law Reform Commission (2013)','http://www.copyrightevidence.org/evidence-wiki/index.php/Australian_Law_Reform_Commission_(2013)',2013,'Copyright and the Digital Economy','This Report is the result of an inquiry into whether the Copyright Act 1968 needs amendment to allow Australia to fully participate in a modern, digital economy. The Report makes a number of recommendations, the overall effect of which will be a more flexible and adaptive copyright framework. The reforms will enhance access to cultural material, without undermining incentives to create. The recommended exceptions are also intended to be more consistent with public standards of fairness.\nThe Terms of Reference for this Inquiry focus on exceptions to copyright law. Exceptions allow certain uses of copyright material that would otherwise be infringements of copyright. Stakeholder input has been highly relevant in identifying the focus of investigation for this Inquiry, and not all exceptions have received consideration. The recommendations in this Report are intended to make the Copyright Act more accessible and better suited to the digital environment, but do not attempt overall redrafting or simplification of the legislation.','The introduction of fair use will mean Australian copyright law can be applied to new technologies and new commercial and consumer practices, without constant recourse to legislative change. Fair use will promote innovation and enable a market-based response to the demands of the digital age.\n\nThe ALRC considers that exceptions to copyright, whether in the form of a specific rule or a general standard, should only permit the unlicensed use of copyright material where this would be fair. It should therefore not be surprising that fair use and each of its illustrative purposes, and the handful of specific exceptions recommended in this Report, have much in common. Generally, they permit the unlicensed use of copyright material if this would:\n• serve an important public purpose;\n• stimulate the creation of new works and the use of existing works for new purposes; and\n• not harm rights holders’ markets—ensuring exceptions do not undermine the crucial incentive to create and publish copyright material.','The Case for Fair Use\n*Recommendation 4–1 The Copyright Act 1968 (Cth) should provide an exception for fair use.\n\nThe Fair Use Exception\n*Recommendation 5–1 The fair use exception should contain:\n(a) an express statement that a fair use of copyright material does not infringe copyright;\n(b) a non-exhaustive list of the factors to be considered in determining whether the use is a fair use (‘the fairness factors’); and\n(c) a non-exhaustive list of illustrative uses or purposes that may qualify as fair use (‘the illustrative purposes’).\n*Recommendation 5–2 The non-exhaustive list of fairness factors should be:\n(a) the purpose and character of the use;\n(b) the nature of the copyright material;\n(c) the amount and substantiality of the part used; and\n(d) the effect of the use upon the potential market for, or value of, the copyright material.\n*Recommendation 5–3 The non-exhaustive list of illustrative purposes should include the following:\n(a) research or study;\n(b) criticism or review;\n(c) parody or satire;\n(d) reporting news;\n(e) professional advice;\n(f) quotation;\n(g) non-commercial private use;\n(h) incidental or technical use;\n(i) library or archive use;\n14 Copyright and the Digital Economy\n(j) education; and\n(k) access for people with disability.\n*Recommendation 5–4 The Copyright Act should be amended to repeal the following exceptions:\n(a) ss 40, 103C—fair dealing for research or study;\n(b) ss 41, 103A—fair dealing for criticism or review;\n(c) ss 41A, 103AA—fair dealing for parody or satire;\n(d) ss 42, 103B—fair dealing for reporting news;\n(e) s 43(2)—fair dealing for a legal practitioner, registered patent attorney or registered trade marks attorney giving professional advice; and\n(f) ss 104(b) and (c)—professional advice exceptions.\nThe fair use or new fair dealing exception should be applied when determining whether one of these uses infringes copyright.\n\nThe New Fair Dealing Exception\n*Recommendation 6–1 If fair use is not enacted, the Copyright Act should be amended to provide that a fair dealing with copyright material for one of the following purposes does not infringe copyright:\n(a) research or study;\n(b) criticism or review;\n(c) parody or satire;\n(d) reporting news;\n(e) professional advice;\n(f) quotation;\n(g) non-commercial private use;\n(h) incidental or technical use;\n(i) library or archive use;\n(j) education; and\n(k) access for people with disability.\n\nThis provision should also provide that the fairness factors should be considered when determining whether the dealing is fair, along with any other relevant matter.\nNote: This consolidates the existing fair dealing exceptions and provides that fair dealings for certain new purposes ((f)-(k)) also do not infringe copyright. Importantly, unlike fair use, this exception can only apply to a use of copyright material for one of the prescribed purposes. The purposes are not illustrative.\n\nStatutory Licences\n*Recommendation 8–1 The Copyright Act should be amended to clarify that the statutory licences in pts VA, VB and VII div 2 do not apply to a use of copyright material which, because of another provision of the Act, would not infringe copyright. This means that governments, educational institutions and institutions assisting people with disability, will be able to rely on unremunerated exceptions, including fair use or the new fair dealing exception, to the extent that they apply.\n*Recommendation 8–2 The Copyright Act should be amended to clarify that the statutory licences in pts VA, VB and VII div 2 do not apply to a use of copyright material where a government, educational institution, or an institution assisting people with disability, instead relies on an alternative licence, whether obtained directly from rights holders or from a collecting society.\n*Recommendation 8–3 The Copyright Act should be amended to remove any requirement that, to rely on the statutory licence in pt VII div 2, governments must notify or pay equitable remuneration to a declared collecting society. Governments should have the option to notify and pay equitable remuneration directly to rights holders, where this is possible.\n*Recommendation 8–4 The statutory licences in pts VA, VB and VII div 2 of the Copyright Act should be made less prescriptive. Detailed provisions concerning the setting of equitable remuneration, remuneration notices, records notices, sampling notices, and record keeping should be removed. The Act should not require sampling surveys to be conducted. Instead, the Act should simply provide that the amount of equitable remuneration and other terms of the licences should be agreed between the relevant parties, or failing agreement, determined by the Copyright Tribunal.\n\nQuotation\n*Recommendation 9–1 The fair use or new fair dealing exception should be applied when determining whether a quotation infringes copyright.\n\nPrivate Use and Social Use\n*Recommendation 10–1 The exceptions for format shifting and time shifting in ss 47J, 109A, 110AA and 111 of the Copyright Act should be repealed. The fair use or new fair dealing exception should be applied when determining whether a private use infringes copyright.\n\nIncidental or Technical Use and Data and Text Mining\n*Recommendation 11–1 The exceptions for temporary uses and proxy web caching in ss 43A, 111A, 43B, 111B and 200AAA of the Copyright Act should be repealed. The fair use or new fair dealing exception should be applied when determining whether incidental or technical uses infringes copyright.\n\nLibraries and Archives\n*Recommendation 12–1 Section 200AB of the Copyright Act should be repealed. The fair use or new fair dealing exception should be applied when determining whether uses by libraries and archives infringes copyright.\n*Recommendation 12–2 The exceptions for preservation copying in ss 51A, 51B, 110B, 110BA and 112AA of the Copyright Act should be repealed. The Copyright Act should provide for a new exception that permits libraries and archives to use copyright material for preservation purposes. The exception should not limit the number or format of copies that may be made.\n\nOrphan Works\n*Recommendation 13–1 The Copyright Act should be amended to limit the remedies available in an action for infringement of copyright, where it is established that, at the time of the infringement:\n(a) a reasonably diligent search for the rights holder had been conducted and the rights holder had not been found; and\n(b) as far as reasonably possible, the user of the work has clearly attributed it to the author.\n*Recommendation 13–2 The Copyright Act should provide that, in determining whether a reasonably diligent search was conducted, regard may be had to, among other things:\n(a) the nature of the copyright material;\n(b) how and by whom the search was conducted;\n(c) the search technologies, databases and registers available at the time; and\n(d) any guidelines, protocols or industry practices about conducting diligent searches available at the time.\n\nEducation\n*Recommendation 14–1 The exceptions for educational use in ss 28, 44, 200, 200AAA and 200AB of the Copyright Act should be repealed. The fair use or new fair dealing exception should be applied when determining whether an educational use infringes copyright.\n\nGovernment Use\n*Recommendation 15–1 The parliamentary libraries exceptions in ss 48A, 50(1)(aa) and 104 of the Copyright Act should be extended to apply to all types of copyright material and all exclusive rights.\n*Recommendation 15–2 The Copyright Act should provide for a new exception for the purpose of the proceedings of a tribunal, or for reporting those proceedings.\n*Recommendations 17\n*Recommendation 15–3 The Copyright Act should provide for a new exception for the purpose of the proceedings of a royal commission or a statutory inquiry, or for reporting those proceedings.\n*Recommendation 15–4 The Copyright Act should provide for a new exception for uses where statutes require local, state or Commonwealth governments to provide public access to copyright material.\n*Recommendation 15–5 The Copyright Act should provide for a new exception for use of correspondence and other material sent to government. This exception should not extend to uses that make previously published material publicly available.\n\nAccess for People with Disability\n*Recommendation 16–1 The fair use or new fair dealing exception should be applied when determining whether a use for access for people with disability infringes copyright.\n\nRetransmission of Free-to-air Broadcasts\n*Recommendation 18–1 In developing media and communications policy, and in responding to media convergence, the Australian Government should consider whether the retransmission scheme for free-to-air broadcasts provided by pt VC of the Copyright Act and s 212(2) of the Broadcasting Services Act 1992 (Cth) should be repealed.\nNote: This would effectively leave the extent to which retransmission occurs entirely to negotiation between the parties—broadcasters, retransmitters and underlying copyright holders.\nRecommendation 18–2 If the retransmission scheme is retained, the scope and application of the internet exclusion in s 135ZZJA of the Copyright Act should be clarified.\n\nBroadcasting\n*Recommendation 19–1 In developing media and communications policy, and in responding to media convergence, the Australian Government should consider whether the following exceptions in the Copyright Act should be repealed:\n(a) s 45—broadcast of extracts of works;\n(b) ss 47, 70 and 107—reproduction for broadcasting;\n(c) s 109—broadcasting of sound recordings;\n(d) ss 65 and 67—incidental broadcast of artistic works; and\n(e) s 199—reception of broadcasts.\n*Recommendation 19–2 The Australian Government should also consider whether the following exceptions should be amended to extend to the transmission of linear television or radio programs using the internet or other forms of communication to the public:\n(a) s 47A—sound broadcasting by holders of a print disability radio licence; and\n(b) pt VA—copying of broadcasts by educational institutions.\n\nContracting Out\n*Recommendation 20–1 The Copyright Act should provide that any term of an agreement that restricts or prevents the doing of an act, which would otherwise be permitted by specific libraries and archives exceptions, is unenforceable.\n*Recommendation 20–2 The Copyright Act should not provide statutory limitations on contracting out of the fair use exception.

We exploit key differences across funding streams within the academic life sciences to estimate the impact of incentives on the rate and direction of scientific exploration. Specifically, we study the careers of investigators of the Howard Hughes Medical Institute (HHMI), which tolerates early failure, rewards long-term success, and gives its appointees great freedom to experiment, and grantees from the National Institutes of Health (NIH), who are subject to short review cycles, predefined deliverables, and renewal policies unforgiving of failure. Using a combination of propensity-score weighting and difference-in-differences estimation strategies, we find that HHMI investigators produce high-impact articles at a much higher rate than a control group of similarly accomplished NIH-funded scientists. Moreover, the direction of their research changes in ways that suggest the program induces them to explore novel lines of inquiry.','Main results: \n\n*Compared the effectiveness of two different ways of funding research by the HHMI (Howard Hughes Medical Institute) and NIH (National Institute of Health). The NIH funding was given to projects while HHMI funding was given to an individual.\n\n*Found that the individuals selected for HHMI funding produced more papers with higher amounts of citations then their counterparts in the NIH\n\n*The reason for this seemed to be that HHMI funded individuals could abandon unfruitful project more easily and move onto something potentially more fruitful. In the NIH however the funding was given to the project which did not give researchers at the NIH the same level of freedom to switch projects when they were found to be potentially unsuccesful.\n\n*The HHMI also had a more flexible review process initially and a more generous termination process which gave the researcher a bit more security compared to a harsher review conducted on NIH researchers.','Policy implications: \n\n*Changing the review process for grant winners could inrease total amount of papers published by scientists as there would be less pressure on researchers early in the project.\n\n*Differences in the way projects are funded could allow scientists to publish more papers as since if an individual is funded it allows more flexibility to change or tweak projects compared to the project itself being funded, which does not necessarily allow for such flexibility.','http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1756-2171.2011.00140.x/abstract',NULL,0,0,0,''),('Bae_and_Choi_(2006)','Bae and Choi (2006)','http://www.copyrightevidence.org/evidence-wiki/index.php/Bae_and_Choi_(2006)',2005,'A Model of Piracy','This paper develops a simple model of software piracy to analyze the short-run effects of piracy\non software usage and the long-run effects on development incentives.

Because we lack evidence on the rate at which unpaid consumption displaces paid consumption, we know little about the size of the effect of pirate consumption on the volume of paid consumption. We provide direct evidence on both the volume of unpaid consumption and the rate of sales displacement for movies in China using two surveys administered in late 2008 and mid-2009. First, using a survey of Chinese college students’ movie consumption and an empirical approach parallel to a similar recent study of US college students, we find that three quarters of movie consumption is unpaid and that each instance of unpaid consumption displaces 0.14 paid consumption instances. Second, a survey of online Chinese consumers reveals similar patterns of paid and unpaid movie consumption but a displacement rate of roughly zero. We speculate on the small displacement rate finding relative to most of the piracy literature.','* Both paid and unpaid consumption of movies rise sharply in self-reported interest in movies\n\n* Paid consumption rises with family income and unpaid consumption falls, though not statistically significant\n\n* Chinese consumers view lesser movies compared to US (30 vs. 50)\n\n*Unpaid consumption makes up far larger share of consumption for the chinese respondents (roughly three quarters) compared to 5% in US.\n\n* Sales displacement is smaller in case of China compared to US.

A typical statute that increases copyright breadth generates an increase in a firm’s excess return to equity of 40–209 basis points, depending on the exact time frame, the size of the firm, and the importance of the change in statutory law. A typical high-court decision expanding copyright generates a 13–105 basis-point increase in excess returns. Our results are robust across 4–5-year subsamples and the size distribution of firms. Our statutory findings are strongest in the most recent portion of the sample.','* The authors have calculated measures of changes in copyright law derived from both statutory and case law; they find that within a standard model of firm-level equity valuation, excess returns to equity in copyright industries are significantly influenced by changes in the breadth of copyright protection.\n\n* The average statutory change broadening copyright appears to increase firms’ excess returns by approximately 40 basis points; if one focuses on especially important statutes, this estimate climbs to 140–70 basis points, and if one focuses on relatively larger firms over the most recent sample period, the estimate rises to 209 basis points.\n\n* To the authors\' knowledge, this is the first evidence to suggest that the breadth of copyright law is important in determining the performance of firms in copyright industries.','This paper has not determined whether equity value increases because changes in the law render existing materials more valuable or because of increased incentive to create new creative works.

By the time a jury reaches the question of substantial similarity, however, the court has usually heard and analyzed a good deal of evidence: about the plaintiff, the defendant, the creativity involved, the process through which the work was created, the reasons for which the work was produced, the defendant’s own creative efforts and behavior, and on occasion the market effects of the defendant’s copying. Despite having this large body of evidence before it, the jury is required to answer the question of substantial similarity through a mere comparison of the two works. In this Essay, we report results from a series of experiments in which subjects were presented with a pair of images and asked to assess the similarity between the two works using the criteria ordinarily given to fact-finders for the substantial similarity determination. When provided with additional information about the simple fact of copying, or about the amount of creative effort that went into the protected work, we saw an appreciable variation (i.e., upwards) in subjects’ assessments of similarity between the works, suggesting that fact-finders are sensitive to additional information about the two works and the creators who produced them, contrary to what current law assumes. Our study suggests that the availability and salience of such additional information actively distorts fact-finders\' assessments of the similarity between the two works, calling into question the purported objectivity of the substantial similarity requirement as a whole.','* Basic knowledge about the act of copying, meaning that one work was copied from the other, greatly influences individuals’ assessments of similarity. And since substantial similarity is presented as a question to the jury once copying as a factual matter is shown to exist, the substantial similarity question is structurally skewed in favor of a jury’s finding greater—i.e., substantial—similarity between the two works.\n\n* In addition to simple knowledge about the copying, additional information about the creator’s efforts in producing the work also triggers individuals’ intuitions that cause them to find a greater amount of similarity between two works. \n\n* Our study leads us to conclude that while it may be true as a matter of theory that liability for copyright infringement is indeed “strict,” in practice this is perhaps largely untrue, since decision-makers are indeed “judging” the defendant’s actions in assessing similarity. Given this reality, it is perhaps time for copyright law to reconsider its dogmatic adherence to a model of strict liability—in both theory and practice.','Since decision-makers are indeed “judging” the defendant’s actions in assessing similarity, it is perhaps time for copyright law to reconsider its dogmatic adherence to a model of strict liability—in both theory and practice.','http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2409811','http://scholarship.law.upenn.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=2184&context=faculty_scholarship',0,0,0,'Two separate surveys; 152 partcipated in the first one and 493 individuals participated in the second one.'),('Band_(2013)','Band (2013)','http://www.copyrightevidence.org/evidence-wiki/index.php/Band_(2013)',2013,'CEO compensation in copyright-intensive industries','In June 2013, the author produced a study on the profitability of copyright-intensive industries by comparing the compensation of the chief executive officers of these same 30 firms over the past six years.

However, as has been noted in numerous impartial studies, the actual impact of infringement on individual firms, on industry sectors, and on the U.S. economy as a whole, is extremely difficult to quantify. In contrast, what can be quantified with relative ease is the performance of firms in the copyright-intensive industries in terms that matter to investors: revenue, profit, and most importantly, profitability. Furthermore, the performance of firms in the copyright-intensive industries can readily be compared with the performance of firms in other industries. While such a comparison may not demonstrate the effect of infringement, it could provide guidance to policymakers as to whether the copyright-intensive industries require additional government assistance in the form of new legislation or law enforcement resources. In this study, the authors have examined the performance over the past ten years of five leading firms in three copyright-intensive industries: motion pictures, publishing, and software. They then examined the performance of five leading firms in three other industries: construction, transportation, and mining.

Moreover, the firms in the copyright-intensive industries may have been even more profitable if they did not have to contend with copyright infringement.\n\n* Nonetheless, the high level of profitability of the copyright-intensive industries suggests that the copyright system serves these industries effectively, and that they are not in need of special assistance from Congress or the Executive Branch.

The results of this paper suggest that the existing socio-economic conditions and the lack of proper institutions in developing and emerging economies may be responsible for high software piracy rates. One may, therefore, infer that the current trends of globalization and socio-economic development may help software piracy in developing countries.','Main results: \n\n*Higher per capita income improves the ability to pay for new software, and therefore will lower the piracy rate.\n\n*The piracy rate is not influenced by changes in the Gini coefficient, a measure of income inequality. This is because of the differing effects of inequality on piracy rates. \n\n*In the presence of LNYCAP (Logarithm of per capita gross domestic product in USD), which is a strong measure of ability to pay, the effect of income inequality is dampened.\n\n*Total revenue from the retail software market, as a share of GDP, has a positive and statistically significant effect on piracy rate.\n\n*The results on the inclusion of Openness (OPEN) as an economic factor show that a more open economic environment reduces the incentive to pirate. \n\n*If the market is open, and both legitimate and pirated software are available, buyers can easily see the benefits of buying the legitimate software, which comes with a warranty and an after-sale service. Obviously, this will reduce the demand and shrink the market for pirated software.\n\n*The results show a negative and statistically significant relationship between Corruption Perception Index and the piracy rate. \n\n*The results suggest that greater civil liberty suppresses the incentive for software piracy.\n\n*Countries such as USA and Australia, which have better record of civil liberties, experience a very low piracy rate as compared to very high software piracy in countries like China where civil liberty is often violated. \n\n*Inclusion of economic freedom indicates that economically free economies experience a low piracy rate. It is also true that economic freedom enhances market competition and eliminates distortions. This implies a depressed market for pirated software.','Policy implications: \n\n*Economic development, more openness, less corrupt governments, softening of political and civil rights would directly influence the benefits or cost of pirating and would thus lead to a reduction in software piracy. \n\n*The recent trend towards globalization and trade liberalization will force the ruling regimes to move from control to a market economy as well as to design and implement policies to control corruption, more economic freedom, civil and political rights. \n\n*China’s accession to the World Trade Organisation (WTO) has important implications for China to take steps towards more transparent policies to control software piracy. \n\n*It may be expected that these measures will help to reduce the rate of software piracy throughout the globe.

Can this phenomenon just be explained as the exploitative extraction of surplus value from the work of users, or is something else, potentially more profound and challenging, playing out here? Does consumer co-creation contribute to the precarious conditions of professional creative workers? This article draws from ethnographic research undertaken from 2000 to 2005 with Auran games (a game development company based in Brisbane, Australia) to engage with debates about the status of user co-creation as labour. The article argues that as a hybrid and emergent social network market these relationships introduce a form of creative destruction to labour relations in the context of the creative industries.','* For waged labour, there is the threat of displacement by unpaid amateurs and the loss or redefinition of work. For amateurs there is the question of whether pursuing their passions through creative production is something to be constructed as ‘enabled’ by commercial entities or ‘exploited’ by commercial entities. \n* User-led production is messier and often driven by a diverse range of motivations that cannot be marshalled into the institutional forms of industrial style production. The consequences of commercial enterprises coming to rely on this form of production to varying degrees is not necessarily outright cooptation or appropriation, but the emergence of new social network market institutions and processes, in which the commercial entities are changing shape as they seek to harness the productive activities of amateurs.','* In trying for a more nuanced account of labour in a networked production environment, we are not seeking to deny the uneven power relations that exist between enterprise and user creators. However, if there is to be any chance of evening up the power relations, users must be understood as having agency, and the characteristics of that agency and the forms of power it generates must be articulated in order to be mobilized. \n* In terms of policy and regulation the challenge will be to identify where intervention is necessary, particularly to address matters of equity, but not to stifle the innovation processes in doing so. Understanding the changed form of the market requires that regulatory interventions change as well.

The survey was designed to inform Industry Canada\'s policy development work and ultimately therefore support better policy decisions regarding the copyright law in Canada. In order to support its policy decisions regarding the copyright regime in Canada, Industry Canada commissioned a survey by Decima Research in 2006 which was designed to measure the extent to which peer to peer (P2P) file-sharing activities act as substitutes or complements to music purchases. Given this purpose the Decima survey asked respondents to comment on their behaviour in the absence of P2P file-sharing, as follows:\n\nConsidering the songs that you downloaded for free through P2P networks during 2005\na) what % would you have purchased at paid music sites if they were not available through P2P\nb) what % would you have purchased as part of a music CD if they were not available through P2P\n\nAfter analyzing the answers to this question, I report on two key findings:\n1. three out of every four respondents said that if P2P were not available they would have purchased some or all of the music which they downloaded; and\n2. almost two-thirds of the hardcore P2P downloaders (those who indicated in the survey that they only acquired music by P2P) said they would have purchased one-third of the tracks they downloaded if the songs were not available on P2P network. This is estimated to amount to an average additional expense of $168 per person, adding up to hundreds of millions of dollars in extra revenue for the music industry per year from this group alone.\n\nThis analysis of survey data then suggests that P2P downloads have strong negative effects on legitimate music purchases and that P2P downloading acts as a substitute for legitimate music purchases. One might reasonably infer from this analysis that stronger copyright laws would substantially increase music purchases and music industry sales revenues and, by implication, increase artist income, industry employment, economic growth and government tax revenues in Canada. My analysis not only focuses on an important survey question which to date has not been analysed by the researchers hired by Industry Canada, it also contradicts the results of the original analysis of the data commissioned by Industry Canada, first published on Industry Canada’s website in a 2007 report entitled, “Don’t blame the P2P file-sharers: the impact of free music downloads on the purchase of music CDs in Canada”, and then subsequently republished with changes by the authors in the Journal of Evolutionary Economics in 2010.','The main results of this study are:\n\n* Contrary to the prior study by Andersen and Frenz (2010) and analysis of the same data, Barker concludes that the presence of P2P networks reduces the amount of money spent by downloaders on legitimate music purposes.\n\n* Stronger copyright laws that effectively reduce and deter free P2P music file-sharing would tend to increase music purchasing and music industry sales and, by implication, increase artist revenues and industry employment and contribute to both economic growth and higher government tax revenues. \n\n* Weaker copyright laws reduce music purchases, music industry sales, artist revenues, industry employment, GDP and government tax revenues.','Stronger copyright laws would substantially increase music purchases and music industry sales revenues and, by implication, increase artist income, industry employment, economic growth and government tax revenues in Canada.','http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1990153','http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1990153',0,0,0,'This study uses secondary data from a pre-existing 2006 telephone survey of 2100 randomly selected Canadians aged 15+.

All of our regression results (reported in Tables 2 and 3 below) show a negative association between P2P downloading and CD demand as might be expected. We consistently find a negative and statistically significant partial correlation between CD purchases and P2P downloads. The range of these estimated correlations is between -0.039 and -0.050, with more consistent, mid-range values coming from the difference on difference regressions (-0.041 and -0.043). This implies a 10% increase in P2P downloads reduces CD demand by around 0.4%.\nThis paper extends the work of Barker (2012) which analysed a question in the Industry Canada survey which asked respondents to comment on their likely behaviour in the absence of P2P file-sharing.

Barker’s (2012) analysis is consistent with our results here however in also suggesting P2P downloads have negative effects on legitimate music purchases.','*Negative association between P2P downloading and CD demand. Consistent negative and statistically significant partial correlation between CD demand and P2P downloads.\n\n*In this paper we have corrected for two fundamental errors in previous analysis by AF leading to their erroneous conclusion. First we corrected for the fact AF biased their results by excluding from their analysis the group of consumers who had completely stopped purchasing CD’s (potentially because of P2P activity) prior to 2005. This is the very group who were most responsive, or likely to have substituted P2P downloading for CD purchases. Second we controlled for the fact that the level of an individual’s demand for CD’s, and the level of an individual’s P2P downloading may be correlated simply because they are both affected by the same third factor, such as love of music, so that high (or low) levels of CD demand is likely to be associated with high (low) levels of P2P demand. Such a positive association between the level of demand and level of P2P downloading may have led AF to mistakenly conclude they had found evidence of a positive market creation effect, as AF regressed the level of individuals CD demand against the level of individuals P2P downloading. Instead we focused on the changes in CD demand and changes in P2P downloading, using data in the survey that AF ignored on 2004 and 2005 behaviours of participants. By focusing on a longitudinal analysis of how the change in individual P2P downloading behaviour affected the change in CD demand we were better able to isolate the true relationship between increases or changes in P2P downloading and changes in CD demand.','This report examines data on the effects of Internet peer-to-peer (P2P) file sharing activities on music purchasing which were obtained from a survey commissioned by Industry Canada.

New game show, casting, soap, telenovela, documentary and other formats are sold to broadcasting stations in dozens of countries, leading to a worldwide multi-billion dollar industry. As an analysis of U.S. and European intellectual property law demonstrates, TV show formats are difficult to protect by intellectual property law. Standard theory would predict that in the absence of intellectual property protection, the TV show format industry has insufficient incentives to invest in creative innovation. This article presents a novel theory to explain why the TV show format market is thriving despite a low level of format protection. On the supply side of the industry, demand for TV show formats is hard to predict, return on them is highly skewed, and market participants are both developing original formats and imitating others’ formats. On the demand side, TV show formats are experience goods, and TV viewers sometimes prefer familiar products. As a result, the TV show format market is subject to herding effects on both sides of the market. The interaction of supply-side and demand-side herding leads to fashion cycles in TV show formats. The industry uses the limited protection against format imitation, but has adapted to the fashion cycle. This article tells the story of how an industry has developed institutions enabling it to cope with uncertain demand and unpredictable profitability, while benefiting from limited appropriability of innovation and from the fashion cycles which underlie the innovative process. It demonstrates the great diversity and flexibility of appropriation strategies in a world of limited and uncertain allocation of property rights.','This Article has proposed a novel theory to explain how the TV format industry is able to cope with format imitation beyond the limited degree of format protection. Like other media industries, the TV format industry is characterized by supply-side and demand-side herding effects that lead to fashion cycles, which are limited in duration. Unlike other media industries, the TV format industry has developed mechanisms to cope with this situation, without having to rely too much on format protection. Beyond a core protection against close format imitation, format developers and broadcasters, who are often both innovators and imitators, benefit from a regime of free-format appropriability, as this enables them to allocate profitability risk across the industry and to cope with uncertainty of demand. TV formats go in and out of fashion, and the format industry has developed tools to coordinate and ride the fashion cycle. The key to understanding TV format imitation is the cycle that can make an industry thrive beyond the borders of a weak property regime.','Being successful in a market such as the TV Formats market may not require stronger intellectual property protection. Rather, it requires market participants to figure out smart ways to combine protection and imitation strategies.\nIntellectual property law should be careful not to base its policies on a simple economic account of property rights as a solution to a public goods problem. Rather, it should embrace the great diversity and flexibility of appropriation strategies in a world of limited allocation of property rights.','http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2191664','http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2191664',1,0,1,'This study uses data from 80 US and EU cases dealing with IP infringement of TV formats, as well as a literature review.f'),('Beebe_(2008)','Beebe (2008)','http://www.copyrightevidence.org/evidence-wiki/index.php/Beebe_(2008)',2008,'An Empirical Study of U.S. Copyright Fair Use Opinions, 1978-2005','Section 107 of the Copyright Act of 1976 establishes the affirmative defense to copyright infringement of “fair use,” by far the most enigmatic doctrine in U.S. copyright law and by far the most important. Without it, much of our economic and communicative action would constitute copyright infringement.   Yet despite the importance of the fair use defense, and despite the enormous amount of scholarly attention that it has received, we continue to lack any systematic, comprehensive account of our fair use case law and the actual state of our fair use doctrine. Instead, our conventional wisdom derives from a small set of conventionally agreed-upon leading cases. This Article presents the results of the first empirical study of our fair use case law to show that much of our conventional wisdom about that case law is mistaken. Working from a data set consisting of all reported federal opinions that made substantial use of the section 107 four-factor test for fair use through 2005, the Article shows which factors and subfactors actually drive the outcome of the fair use test in practice, how the fair use factors interact, how courts inflect certain individual factors, and the extent to which judges stampede the factor outcomes to conform to the overall test outcome. It also presents empirical evidence of the extent to which lower courts either deliberately ignored or were ignorant of fair use doctrine set forth in the leading cases, particularly those from the Supreme Court. Based on these descriptive findings, the Article prescribes a set of doctrinal practices that will improve courts’ adjudication of the fair use defense.','- Between 1976 and 2005, federal courts reported 306 opinions, 215 of which made substantial use the four factors of s. 107, which the author notes is a surprisingly small number.\n\n- The Second and Ninth Circuit reported the highest number of cases and heavily influence other circuits even though the decisions are not directly precedential.\n\n- The outcome of the case is heavily driven by the fourth factor (commercial use/effect on potential market) and less strongly driven by the first factor (purpose and character).

This literature, which started in the mid-1980s, really mushroomed at the turn of the 21st century when digital piracy became a topic of intense debate.\n\n* Initially, in terms of welfare, it was considered that piracy was likely to improve welfare in the short run (as the deadweight loss of monopoly is reduced) but to deteriorate it in the long run (as lower profits imply lower incentives to create and to improve products). These conclusions were established in a number of seminal papers considering a simple monopoly framework.\n\n* Subsequent analyses extended this basic approach in several directions. First, it was suggested that piracy also had the potential to increase the right-holders’ profits.

This puts freelancers in a difficult position as they are often bound by individual contracts imposed on them by publishers, broadcasting organizations and other entrepreneurs whose businesses have been created expressly for the exploitation of the works and who usually have the benefit of legal opinion. \n* The transfer of rights is becoming a standard business practice, often through forms that require authors to transfer their rights on a perpetual basis for a one-off payment. \n* The current UK system permits waiver of moral rights, which undermines the protections and calls into question their effectiveness. \n* UK contract laws are in conflict and often overcome intended copyright protections.','Without widespread awareness of individual rights and ideal contracting practices, legal reforms would possibly prove ineffective. If reforms are to have a significant impact, this will be through the adoption of collective agreements in particular sectors of the cultural industries.\n\nThree reasons why reform of the law of authors’ contracts is desirable at a global level are: \n* creators’ rights are human rights, and therefore strong moral rights and rights to \nremuneration should be available to all authors; \n\n* reforming authors’ contracts and moral rights at an international level will significantly resolve the problems of “conflicts of law”; and\n\n* international harmonization of these provisions will prevent exploiters electing to commission work in countries where the law protecting authors is weak.','http://creatorsrights.org.uk/media/between.pdf','http://creatorsrights.org.uk/media/between.pdf',1,0,1,'Many of the datasets referenced are documented through various reports and consultations, especially through representatives of the various members of the CRA. \n\nVarious secondary data sources are used as support for recommendations and findings.'),('Bessen_(2005)','Bessen (2005)','http://www.copyrightevidence.org/evidence-wiki/index.php/Bessen_(2005)',2005,'Open source software: Free provision of complex public goods','Open source software, developed by volunteers, appears counter to the conventional wisdom that private provision of public goods is socially more efficient. But complexity makes a difference. Under standard models, development contracts for specialized software may be difficult to write and ownership rights do not necessarily elicit socially optimal effort. I consider three mechanisms that improve the likelihood that firms can obtain the software they need: pre-packaged software, Application Program Interfaces (APIs) and Free/Open Source software (FOSS). I show that with complex software, some firms will choose to participate in FOSS over both \"make or buy\" and this increases social welfare. In general, FOSS complements proprietary provision, rather than replacing it. Pre-packaged software can coexist in the marketplace with FOSS: pre-packaged software addresses common uses with limited feature sets, while firms with specialized, more complex needs use FOSS.','This analysis may help dispel two myths about F/OSS (Free/Open Source Software):\n\n* First, it is not a “communistic,” “property destroying” alternative to proprietary software. It is better viewed as a complement to proprietary provision, recognizing that proprietary provision fails to effectively meet the needs of many customers in markets where customers have highly disparate needs and products are complex.\n\n* Second, it is a mistake to assume that F/OSS is somehow less robust because it is based on voluntary contributions rather than driven by the profit incentive. In fact, the firms that participate in F/OSS are driven by the profit incentive – F/OSS is just the most socially efficient means for many of them to obtain the software they need in their profit-making activities.\n\nManagers need to view F/OSS as an alternative to simple “make-or-buy.” This alternative will make the most sense for firms with specialized and complex needs. And it may be\nespecially important in emerging technologies where markets are initially small.','Managers need to view F/OSS as an alternative to simple “make-or-buy.” This alternative will make the most sense for firms with specialized and complex needs.

These same advancements, however, have also reduced the costs and increased the availability throughout the world of the technology used to copy or pirate these products. Consequently, the enforcement of intellectual property rights is among the primary concerns of software publishers, music labels, movie studios, and other producers within industries affected by piracy. Developers of information-based products have appealed to various national governments and international organizations for assistance in clearly defining and enforcing intellectual property rights at both national and international levels. Examining socio-economic influences on software piracy in the United States, the authors find a negative relationship between software piracy and income, tax burdens, and economic freedom. A 1% increase in per-capita income correlates with a 0.25% reduction in piracy.','* As lesser-developed countries continue to experience economic growth and increased personal income, software piracy may well naturally abate. This does not imply that policies enforcing intellectual property rights are unworthy, but that policies that foster economic development and income may have an additional indirect benefit of reducing intellectual property theft.\n\n* One aspect of intellectual property rights not specifically included in previous studies of software piracy is integration, both economic and legal.

Emphasizing threats from peer-to-peer (P2P) technologies, the industry continues to seek sanctions against individuals who offer a significant number of songs for others to copy. Combining data on the performance of music albums on the Billboard charts with file sharing data from a popular network, we assess the impact of recent developments related to the music industry on survival of music albums on the charts and evaluate the specific impact of P2P sharing on an album’s survival on the charts. In the post-P2P era, we find significantly reduced chart survival except for those albums that debut high on the charts. In addition, superstars and female artists continue to exhibit enhanced survival. Finally, we observe a narrowing of the advantage held by major labels. The second phase of our study isolates the impact of file sharing on album survival. We find that, although sharing does not hurt the survival of top-ranked albums, it does have a negative impact on low-ranked albums. These results point to increased risk from rapid information sharing for all but the “cream of the crop.”','* Debut rank has a highly negative impact on album survival, an impact even more pronounced for albums debuting lower on the charts. The superstar effect appears to be alive and well, with albums by such performers surviving approximately 35% longer.

The innovative approaches adopted by the minor labels might be emulated by major labels. In this vein, it has been suggested that sharing through online networks might have beneficial sampling and word-of-mouth effects.

Initial attempts to control online file sharing have been primarily through consumer education and legal action against the operators of networks that facilitated file sharing. Recent legal action against individual file sharers marked an unprecedented shift in the industry’s strategy. The focus now is on well‐publicized legal threats and actions on a relatively small group of individuals to discourage overall music file sharing. To determine the resulting impact of these legal threats, we passively tracked online file‐sharing behavior of over 2,000 individuals.

This has been marketed as a possible gradual transition path between subscription and open access to the scholarly journal literature, and the publishers have pledged to decrease their subscription prices in proportion to the uptake of the hybrid option. The number of hybrid journals has doubled in the past couple of years and is now over 4,300, and the number of such articles was around 12,000 in 2011. On average only 1-2 % of eligible authors utilize the OA option, due mainly to the generally high price level of typically 3,000 USD. There are, however, a few publishers and individual journals with a much higher uptake. This article takes a closer look at the development of hybrid OA and discusses, from an author-centric viewpoint, the possible reasons for the lack of\nsuccess of this business model.','In just over two years the number of journals from major publishers offering hybrid Open Access has more than doubled, from approximately 2,000 to over 4,400. Since the overall numbers of journals from these publishers has remained on the same level, the hybrid share has risen from 25 % to around 50% of all eligible journals. In the same period the number of articles has increased from around 8,000 to 12,000. Roughly half of these articles have been deposited in PubMedCentral by the\npublishers and the share of articles in biomedicine is even higher. \nAmong the lessons learnt is that at the 3,000 USD price level the overwhelming majority of authors do not pay the charges. It is difficult to know to what extent this is due to lack of awareness of the option and of the benefits of OA, unwillingness to pay at the prevailing price level or difficulties in funding the hybrid charge. \nThe overall conclusion of this study must be that the hybrid experiment, at least in the case of the major publishers and with the current price level, has failed as a way of significantly adding to the volumes of OA articles, and that hybrid OA will remain a very marginal phenomenon in the scholarly publishing landscape.','The hybrid offering seems to have reached a state where the prospects for growth are low in the near future. The big publishers have already included around half their titles, probably most of the ones deemed to have better chances of uptake, and many university presses and society publishers already have a clear majority of their titles in their hybrid offering. Thus there is relative little scope for growth via the addition of new titles. The best chances of rapidly increasing the uptake would be to drastically reduce the price level. But that could in turn put the subscription income at risk. Since the marginal cost of keeping the hybrid offering running is almost zero publishers are likely to continue with this route in its current form in the near future. \nBut in parallel the trend seems now to be for many established publishers to start wholly new full Open Access journals, and in particular journals with very broad disciplinary coverage and reasonable article processing charges.','http://www.openaccesspublishing.org/hybrid/hybrid.pdf','http://www.openaccesspublishing.org/hybrid/hybrid.pdf',0,0,0,'The study uses data from 15 publishers of hybrid journals.

The availability of songs on file sharing networks has two competing effects on sales that are likely to vary across artists.\nFirst, there is a direct substitution effect on sales as some consumers download rather\nthan purchase music. Second, there is a penetration effect which increases sales, as the spread of an artist’s works helps to make the artist more well-known throughout the population. The first effect is strongest for ex ante well-known artists, while the second is strongest for ex ante unknown artists. Thus file sharing reduces sales for well-known artists relative to unknown artists. Taking account of this heterogeneity in estimating the effect of file sharing provides strong evidence of this distributional effect. Additionally, I find a large aggregate negative effect on sales not apparent in previous work that failed to account for the differential impacts on more and less wellknown artists. The overall negative impact of file sharing arises because aggregate sales are dominated by sales of well-known artists. Using my estimates of the effect of file sharing, counterfactual exercises suggest that the lawsuits brought by the RIAA have resulted in an increase in album sales of approximately 2.9% during the 23 week period after the lawsuit strategy was publicly announced. Furthermore, if files available on-line were reduced across the board by 30%, industry sales would have been approximately 10% higher in 2003.','* Naïve estimates which do not allow for the effect of file sharing to differ systematically across artists yields results similar to those found in the literature previously, suggesting that file sharing has not had a significant effect on the sales of recorded music.\n\n* Further inspection, however, reveals that it is unrealistic to believe that the effects of file sharing are constant across all artists as the costs and benefits of file sharing differ with the ex ante popularity of the artist. This suggest that ex ante unknown artists are likely to see more positive overall effects of file sharing than ex ante popular artists are.\n\n* Furthermore, the differential effect of file sharing on the sales of artists of different levels of ex ante popularity has led to a dramatic shift in the distribution of sales among artists, as new and less popular artists are now selling more records while star artists have seen their sales shrink, compacting the distribution of outcomes.','The RIAA’s strategy of suing individual file sharing users leads to reduced file sharing activity and sizeable increases in sales.','http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.117.2922&rep=rep1&type=pdf',NULL,0,0,0,'Data set combining data on national-level sales data with data on file sharing activity over more than 60 weeks.'),('Blackburn_(2005)','Blackburn (2005)','http://www.copyrightevidence.org/evidence-wiki/index.php/Blackburn_(2005)',2005,'Essays on the economics of copying with an application to the recorded music industry',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,0,0,0,''),('Bmrb_Social_Research_(2009)','Bmrb Social Research (2009)','http://www.copyrightevidence.org/evidence-wiki/index.php/Bmrb_Social_Research_(2009)',2009,'Future copyright development','This project engaged rights holders and users in a review of the copyright system to help set an agenda for future copyright policy Four copyright areas were explored: access to works; recognition around creative input; incentivising investment and creativity; and authenticating and protecting works.

We show that, in most circumstances, competitive rents allow creative individuals to appropriate a large enough share of the social surplus generated by their innovations to compensate for their opportunity cost.

Finally, we provide various examples of how competitive markets for innovative products would work in the absence of IP and critically discuss a number of common fallacies in the previous literature.','* An almost complete abolition of IP protection would lead to more creative activity, a more efficient allocation of its surplus, and higher social welfare.\n\n* In the standard model of innovation, no innovation takes place under NIP (non IP). While these may not be, and are not in our view, the empirically relevant circumstances, they are those almost invariably adopted to argue for the necessity of strong IP legislation.\n\n* There are abundant doubts on the established wisdom, according to which more IP protection is, from a social viewpoint, always better than less.\n\n* The presence of IP protection may eventually lead to an ever decreasing amount of creation.\n\n* A NIP systems allows the best creative individuals to earn large amounts of money.\n\n* In the IP system, income inequality gets larger  without gains for social welfare.\n\n* The starting point of the economic analysis of innovation is to recognize that the economically relevant unit is a copy of an idea.  Economically valuable copies of ideas do not fall from the heavens, like manna, but are the product of intentional and costly human efforts.','* Even if this should not be the concern of a policy aimed at maximizing social welfare, a NIP system would not necessarily impoverish creative individuals, but instead it would allow the best among them to still earn large amounts of money\n\n* A great deal of common economic wisdom applies equally well to the economics of knowledge\n\n* Property rights in copies of ideas is assured by the ordinary laws against theft – what is ordinarily referred to as “intellectual property” protects not the ownership of copies of ideas, but rather a monopoly over how other people make use of their copies of an idea.','http://ssrn.com/abstract=1144885','http://www.serci.org/rerci.html#Vol2No1',0,0,0,'The authors assess the NIP (non IP) system and characterize its properties.'),('Bonner_and_O\'Higgins_(2010)','Bonner and O\'Higgins (2010)','http://www.copyrightevidence.org/evidence-wiki/index.php/Bonner_and_O\'Higgins_(2010)',2010,'Music piracy: ethical perspectives','Purpose – This paper aims to examine the issue of illegal downloading of music under an ethical lens.\n\nDesign/methodology/approach – The theoretical framework observed was one which included\nthree independent variables: individual, situational and experimental elements. The dependent variable of the study was legal vs illegal downloading of music. A 20-item questionnaire was completed by 84 respondents. The final four questions in the study were guilt-inducing questions(which the respondent was informed of in compliance with ethical primary research); the remainder of the questions were neutral in nature.\n\nFindings – The paper finds that the respondents illegally download despite viewing the act as immoral. Respondents choose to morally disengage from the non-ethical nature of the act in an attempt to avoid feeling guilty about illegal downloading and also to avoid any blame being attributed to them personally. Many respondents feel the act of illegal downloading is simply today’s reality and that there is nothing wrong or immoral about illegal downloading. Those who illegally download were less likely to attack the activity for being wrong. Active music fans were more likely to engage in illegal downloading than passive ones. Being a student versus being gainfully employed did not affect downloading behaviour.\n\nResearch limitations/implications – A limitation of the study was the difficulty in getting people to disclose the truth about their own ethical violations. A related limitation was the difficulty in obtaining respondents, since participation in such a study meant revealing their music consumption behaviour. However, in the end, social networking proved to be a successful way of recruiting participants.\n\nPractical implications – The results cast light on the obstacles managers in the music business face in eliminating music piracy.\n\nSocial implications – The results show the reasons for the difficulties in eliminating this widespread crime, because of the ethical ambiguity involved.\n\nOriginality/value – The study has the effect of explaining music piracy very clearly through the application of ethical/psychological theory. This has not been done before.','This paper investigates this issue through an ethics/psychological lens. It identifies the main offenders of this illegal activity and examines the underlying factors that underpin the commitment of such violations, to help us understand why those responsible act in such a dishonest way. More specifically, this paper argues that: \n\n*As one’s perception of immorality regarding illegal downloading increases, their scaling of such immorality decreases or remains neutral to avoid feelings of guilt and to avoid experiencing cognitive conflict.\n\n* Respondents will continue to illegally download as they feel no problem exists or they feel it is wrong but that if something is available for free they will take it, rather than pay for it, which may prove immoral to many persons.','A solution to illegal downloading may emerge in time, and lead to taming of such activity, through a greater understanding of the psychological forces that drive and maintain it, as evidenced in the research in this paper.',NULL,'http://www.emeraldinsight.com/doi/abs/10.1108/00251741011082099',0,0,0,'The research was conducted by means of a 20-item questionnaire which tested respondents’ attitudes to music, and to illegal downloading in general, as well as their downloading habits.

Controlling for year, income, and the fixed effects within each area, I estimate the relationship between Internet access and CD sales for four age groups. Overall, Internet access has a positive and statistically significant effect on CD sales. For children aged 5 to 14, Internet access has a negative but statistically insignificant effect on CD sales. For youths aged 15 to 24, Internet access has a negative and statistically significant effect on CD sales. And for the adult groups aged 25 to 44 and aged 45 and older, Internet access has a significant positive effect.

The aims and objectives of the research were to establish:\n* the range of different approaches currently being adopted around the world to enforce\ncopyright in the online environment; and\n* the strengths and weaknesses of different approaches and to what extent enforcement approaches are perceived to be working to reduce infringement levels.\nFinally, in order to accomplish these tasks, the brief required the consultants to identify where\nresearch is available on the level of online copyright infringement in each country. The countries chosen by the IPO for inclusion in the research are as follows: United Kingdom (UK); United States (US); Canada (CA); France (FR), the Netherlands (NL); Spain (SP); Italy (IT); Brazil (BR) and South Korea (KR).\nThe research consists primarily of a desk review of policy, legislation, research and data in addition to targeted consultation with government and regulatory bodies, legal experts, rights holders’ organisations, and organisations representing Internet Service Providers (ISPs).

Notice and take down approaches have been developed and streamlined in many countries to be very quick\n\n* In some cases, stakeholders have also raised concerns that notice and take down regimes merely displace hosting activity to other countries (c.f. the Dutch case)5 days in the Netherlands; 12 to 35 days in Italy, 15 days in Spain) and inexpensive\n\n* Demand-side action requires new legislation to be brought into place (15 years in Brazil, 5 years in the UK). These measures are contentious,  bringing rights holders into conflict with both ISPs and civil liberties / consumer groups and NGOs.\n\n* Only Brazil and the Netherlands have dismissed the option of setting up new structures or processes to deal with the phenomenon of online copyright infringement. This suggests one or both of the following, that:\na) existing legal powers and institutions were ill-equipped to deal with the scale and speed of the phenomenon of online copyright enforcement; and\nb) creating new laws and institutions has a ‘signalling’ effect to both domestic and international stakeholders that shows that the issue is being taken seriously\n\n*  The presence of dedicated regulation and legislation has, in several countries, prompted both:\na) The establishment of voluntary measures as part of the overall set-up (e.g. CAS in US, which helps protect ISPs from law suits or in lieu of a fully worked out implementation (as in the UK, where Creative Content UK has been set up in light of the delays in the implementation of the DEA); and\nb) The emergence of market-based solutions in some areas: e.g. services to provide due diligence for advertisers (e.g. White Bullet in the UK and the Internet Advertising Bureau in IT)\n\n*  WIPO takes a similar view to the Commission in thinking that the most effective enforcement mechanism in the medium to long term will be the development of a competitive legal online content market','* The authours conclude that where good levels of cooperation and joint working between ISPs and rights holders can be established (most obviously through voluntary agreements), this can remove much of the friction that otherwise exists in dealing with online copyright enforcement. Arguably, it also reduces the need for new, dedicated regulatory measures and actions.\n\n* In the authors\' view, what has been striking in the development of national approaches to the enforcement of copyright online enforcement has been the lack of shared approaches between countries. This has certainly been the experience of WIPO, who organised a seminar on the role of internet intermediaries vis-à-vis tackling infringement back in 2005.

Although it premised upon the idea that these models would have been greatly affected by the strong protection that digital copyright law offers to rightholders, it concluded the opposite way. The ‘all rights reserved model’ that is tenaciously incentivized by the current legislative framework is, indeed, all but dominant: it is overcome by ‘open’ and ‘interactive’ models that take full advantage from the architecture of the online environment and from flexible forms of copyright licensing. More in general, the results of the empirical analysis show that the current legal framework does not considerably affect the models of distribution that are implemented in practice; rather, they are significantly influenced by many other factors, such as the technology used for making digital content available.\nTherefore, the article acknowledges how the current legal framework is inadequate and inconsistent with the business tools that entrepreneurs are employing and testing to better satisfy the demand. In order to show how the market diverges from the on line distribution model of digital content envisaged at legislative level, in the first section we give an account of the digital age turmoil and expectations, so to show how evidence about on line distribution of digital content is needed. This need is further confirmed by the literature review about distribution models for digital content that we after carried out in section 2. In sections 3 and 4 we describe the methodology followed and present the initial results obtained, which will be further analyzed in section 5 via a cluster analysis. In section 6 we comment and discuss those last so to illustrate, in section 7, our conclusions. We affirm that while the current legal framework, though biased towards a pre-determined solution for online distribution of digital content, has not inhibited the development of a kaleidoscopic market for online distribution, an enabling legal framework could foster it further and, by doing this, could favour the match between the demand and the supply of digital content.','This study shows how legal, technological and economic features operate as ‘differentiating factors’ among the models of digital distribution. In other words, it answers the question on what are the key determinants of the models of online distribution and to what extend the choice of the copyright regime influences the model of distribution:\n\n* The legal features do not represent the major differentiating factor among the identified archetypes. Technology and business, not law, are the key discriminating factor between models of distribution.\n\n* While technology and business are powerful differentiating factors, the models for online distribution seem not to be significantly influenced by the digital content which is distributed. To a certain extent, the same or similar model could apply to the distribution of music, videogames – and, conversely, the same digital content could be distributed according to different legal and business models. \n\n* The current legislative framework suggests a model that, initially, was supposed to be appealing for the business, as it enabled an enhanced control over the content distributed. Yet, entrepreneurs have developed a variety of business models which less and less coincide with what was suggested at the legislative level.','The study concludes that the current legal framework does not answer to the needs and wants of consumers of digital content and that, on the contrary, they should be encompassed within a new and revised copyright law.','http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2358899##','http://ejlt.org/article/view/149/252',0,0,0,'To compose a reliable sample of websites, two criteria of selection have been employed, namely distributed content and popularity.

A large\npercentage of respondents get pirated movies from a variety of channels (on P2P networks, intranet, by physical means. . . ).

Analysis of music consumption in french graduate schools','This paper analyzes the impact of music file sharing on CD purchases. Traditionally, two arguments are opposed concerning the impact of music file sharing on CD sales. On the one hand, MP3 downloads only reduces sales of legitimate CDs (the \"competition effect\"). On the other hand, consumption of free MP3s could lead people to buy CD which they would never have bought otherwise (the “sampling effect”). Because the court in the Napster case and some academic researchers have dismissed this sampling effect, this article seeks to assess whether sampling does indeed occur and in the affirmative what are the relative contributions of the positive sampling and the negative competition effects of MP3 files on CD purchases. To do so, we administered an anonymous online survey in two French graduate schools from May 26 to June 3, 2004. We find that there are two populations: explorers and pirates. For the explorers, MP3 downloading from P2P networks has a positive impact on CD consumption. For the pirates, anonymous file-sharing on the internet and intranets has a negative effect on CD consumption, while physical exchanges have a positive effect.','* This study shows that there are two populations of MP3 users: people who use MP3s to discover new music through file-sharing networks, which leads them to purchase more CDs (the explorers) and people who mainly use file-sharing networks as substitutes to regular CDs (the pirates).\n\n* New business models should discriminate between these two types of users of digital music in order to extract more surplus from the true music fans. There are already some initiatives which allow internet users to download an unlimited amount of music files for a monthly fee or match filesharing users to new artists. New tracking software also expands the space of products of which internet users are aware.\n\n* File-sharing technologies have amplified consumption patterns in the sense that music fans have used MP3 to discover new music and increase their consumption of pre-recorded music while people with low willingness to pay for music have used MP3 files as direct substitutes to legal purchases.','The estimation results have two implications. First, new business models should try and better discriminate between these two types of users of digital music in order to extract more surplus from the true music fans. Secondly, new business models should also encourage the formation of online communities as our results suggest that people who share music through personal contacts among a community have a higher probability to purchase more CDs.','https://dipot.ulb.ac.be/dspace/bitstream/2013/80196/1/Bounie1.pdf','http://difusion.ulb.ac.be/vufind/Record/ULB-DIPOT:oai:dipot.ulb.ac.be:2013/80196/Holdings',0,0,0,'An anonymous online survey was administered in two French graduate schools from May 26 to June 3, 2004.

Its scope, has been to gather quantitative data from 2006-13 and qualitative views and evidence from stakeholders, and to set out the arguments for and against any change in the law.','* Physical infringement offences have important differences from online ones\n\n* Online crimes are harder to understand\n\n* Not all prosecutors appear confident in bringing charges\n\n* The law is not as clear as it could be\n\n* Private prosecutions have used alternative legislation\n\n* Juries appear reluctant to return guilty verdicts on fraud charges\n\n* Even where an alternative approach works, CDPA 1988 does not benefit','\"This study has been asked to consider the available evidence in the light of four main policy options: namely, i) making no change, ii) increasing the penalties for online infringement to match those for physical offences, iii) reducing the physical offences to those currently applied to online offences, or iv) moving one or both sets of sanctions to a new, intermediate level.\"\n\n\"i. The online criminal provisions of CDPA 1988 are hardly being used, if at all. There has been a lack of clarity over how they can be applied, and even if this is addressed, they will not provide access to appropriate and proportionate sentences for serious infringement cases. If no change is made, this problem will continue.\n\nii. There is a case for increasing sanctions relating to online offences, especially if the civil case law is believed to have developed to a point where prosecutions can now be brought successfully against criminal activity. However, safeguards may be needed to ensure that ordinary members of the public and those whose copying is not motivated by a criminal intent are not inadvertently caught by any amended provision. Also, there must be a proportionate approach that permits legitimate experimentation.\n\niii. Custodial sentences in excess of two years have been used for physical copying offences. While no evidence was found of sanctions exceeding five years, the available data does not provide a basis for concluding that the level of physical penalties is inappropriate – it is rare to have the maximum sentence applied to any such crime, but important to have the means to establish a scale of offending.\n\niv. There is logic to placing serious online copyright offences into a more serious category, which soundings taken for this study equate with a maximum sentence of at least five years.

We also find that levels of price dispersion depend importantly on the measures employed. When we compare the prices posted by different Internet retailers we find substantial dispersion. Internet retailer prices differ by an average of 33% for books and 25% for CDs. However, when we weight these prices by proxies for market share, we find dispersion is lower in Internet channels than in conventional channels, reflecting the dominance of certain heavily branded retailers.\nWe conclude that while there is lower friction in many dimensions of Internet competition,\nbranding, awareness, and trust remain important sources of heterogeneity among Internet\nretailers.','* Internet retailers charge lower prices than conventional retailers—whether one considers prices alone or “prices” including the costs of getting the item to the users’ homes (e.g., shipping and handling, taxes, mileage).\n\n* Internet retailers make price changes in smaller increments than comparable conventional retailers.

Copyright and patent laws do this by providing qualifying authors and inventors with a bundle of exclusive rights relating to the use and development of their creations. Importantly, however, these fields differ greatly in the ways that they determine whether some new creation is sufficiently innovative to merit legal protection. Copyright law sets the creativity bar especially low for new works of authorship, whereas patent law demands that a putative inventor prove that her creation is highly innovative. Relatively little research has focused on whether the different IP thresholds affect the incentives and behavior of creators.\n\nLegal scholarship on the effects of differing IP thresholds on creators has generally relied on standard economic assumptions about the way that people respond to incentives. Creators are assumed to be rational and to respond to increased incentives by producing more and better creations. According to this reasoning, because patent law requires more creativity as a precondition to the conferral of IP rights compared to what copyright law requires, creators subject to the patent regime will be encouraged to be more creative than those subject to the copyright regime.\n\nRecent research in the social sciences, however, suggests that the connection between incentives and behavior — particularly with regard to creativity — is not always so straightforward. Although some research indicates that providing incentives to act creatively has the expected effect of increasing creativity, other research suggests that offering certain types of incentives can undermine creative behavior. For example, monetary incentives to perform creative tasks may dampen creativity. Moreover, and importantly for our purposes, increasing the magnitude of an incentive to be creative may not always lead to more or better behavior. Once creativity incentives are sufficiently salient or intense, there is a risk that people will be overly focused on achieving the incentive and “choke.”\n\nIn the series of experiments reported in this Article, we extend the research on the effects of incentives for creativity into the realm of intellectual property. Specifically, we test whether the existence of a creativity threshold that conditions entry into a prize lottery on meeting certain performance standards affects how creative people are. The experiments reported here involve various creativity tasks in which subjects are randomly assigned to conditions that are intended to model the different creativity thresholds employed by copyright and patent law. Doing so allows us to test whether the existence and nature of a threshold increases, decreases, or does not affect subjects’ creativity.\n\nThis research contributes to the growing debates about whether copyright law’s creativity threshold is set too low and should be increased and whether patent law’s creativity threshold is appropriately set. More broadly, this research adds to the growing literature in law, psychology, economics, and management on the effects of incentives on behavior.','* Hypothesis: If IP thresholds affect incentives and behaviour of creators. There were three types of creativity under study 1. Computational, 2. Verbal, 3. Figural\n\n* There were also different thresholds to get into the price draw 5%, 25%, and 50% along with a Copyright condition where the better you did the better chance you had at a payout and lastly a control where there were not monetary incentives.\n\n* Subjects performed better in the high threshold patent conditions compared to the copyright and control groups. Thus no evidence of either crowding-out of intrinsic incentive or a choking effect due to the increased performance pressure  brought on by the increased thresholds.\n\n* However there was little difference between the copyright and the control and between patent conditions. There is some evidence to suggest that some non-trivial thresholds for creativity would incentivize creation.\n\n* There was also a treatment where the task was a simple cognition task . Thus the authors could test if there was a difference in the way subjects were motivated differently by the monetary rewards in different tasks. They found that there was not a significant difference in performance between subject in any of the different threshold conditions in the cognition task, suggesting that thresholds motivate creative output more compared to non-cognition tasks.','For relatively low-stakes creativity involving nonprofessional creators who are motivated externally, low thresholds may not create significant incentives, which suggest for this case copyright law is an incentive for creation.','http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2443667','http://lsr.nellco.org/nyu_lewp/380/',0,0,0,'The data mas survey data collected via Mechanical turk.'),('Buccafusco_(2012)','Buccafusco (2012)','http://www.copyrightevidence.org/evidence-wiki/index.php/Buccafusco_(2012)',2012,'Making Sense of Intellectual Property Law','Despite considerable research suggesting that creators value attribution – i.e., being named as the creator of a work – U.S. intellectual property (IP) law does not provide a right to attribution to the vast majority of creators. On the other side of the Atlantic, however, many European countries give creators, at least in their copyright laws, much stronger rights to attribution. At first blush it may seem that the U.S. has gotten it wrong, and the Europeans have made a better policy choice in providing to creators a right that they value. But for reasons we will explain in this Article, matters are a lot more complicated than that. \n\nThis Article reports a series of experiments that are the first to attempt to quantitatively measure the value of attribution to creators. In previous research, we have shown that creators of IP are subject to a “creativity effect” that results in them assigning substantially higher value to their works than neoclassical economic theory predicts. The first two experiments reported in this Article suggest a way that the creativity effect may be reduced – creators are willing to sacrifice significant economic payments in favor of receiving attribution for their work. The value to creators of attribution raises the question whether U.S. IP law should be re-structured to provide attribution as a creator’s default right. \n\nThe third and most important experiment reported here casts doubt on the value of giving creators such a default right, because creators value attribution differently depending on whether the legal rule gives it to them as an initial entitlement or not. When creators are given a right to attribution as a default they value credit four times higher than when attribution is not the default option. Our findings make clear that creators value attribution, and that the prospect of obtaining it can lead to a more efficient level of transacting. At the same time, and paradoxically, our findings also suggest that before we restructure American law, which provides no right to attribution for the vast majority of creators, we need to take care, because it is possible, under conditions that we will describe, that providing creators with a default right to attribution will result in less efficient transacting. \n\nFinally, our findings have important implications for property theory which are broader than IP law or attribution rights. Our third experiment suggests that a party who enjoys a default legal right as part of her initial complement of rights will tend to treat that legal right in a fashion similar to any other form of initial entitlement, and overvalue it relative to what neoclassical theory would predict. This suggests a principle regarding how to efficiently structure default rules in any setting. All other factors being equal, an efficiently-structured default rule will locate the initial legal entitlement in the party who is either less likely to overvalue the entitlement, or, if overvaluation seems inevitable regardless of where the initial entitlement is placed, is likely to overvalue it less.','* There was one experiment with three different conditions: 1) Contest, 2) Publication, 3) Attribution.\n\n* The first condition was the contest condition,  where the subjects could sell their rights to win a lottery but keep their property rights. \n\n* The second condition (publication)  was similar to the contest condition but the difference is that the photographer now had the chance to have their photo published, uncredited, if they sold their contest rights and won the lottery.\n\n* The final condition (attribution) is similar to the  publication condition  except the photographer would have a credited photo published if they sold their rights to the lottery. \n\n* The idea being that if the subject had a lower willingness to accept (WTA) an offer then they would be more likely to sell their property rights away, but keep the possibility to publish with or without attribution, depending on the condition. What the authors found was that when the photographer had the potential to publish a photo with attribution their WTA was lower than when there  was not a chance to get published with attribution. This result suggests that if  authors were not given attribution rights there would be more transactions of artistic works, which would make it a more efficient market.','Makes a case for attribution rights not being a part of copyright protection.','http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1919210','http://scholarship.kentlaw.iit.edu/fac_schol/733/',0,0,0,'There were three different conditions run with 180 test subjects in total, using mechanical turk (mturk).

Our study of the market for audio books and a related human subjects experiment suggest that all three assertions are suspect. We demonstrate that audio books made from public domain bestsellers (1913-22) are significantly more available than those made from copyrighted bestsellers (1923-32). We also demonstrate that recordings of public domain and copyrighted books are of equal quality. While a low quality recording seems to lower a listener\'s valuation of the underlying work, our data do not suggest any correlation between that valuation and legal status of the underlying work. We also report important pricing data.','Main findings:\n\n*Our data suggest that the three principal arguments in favor of copyright term extension—under-exploitation, over-exploitation, and tarnishment—are unsupported.\n\n*Public domain works were twice as likely to be available in audio book format, and for the sample of enduringly popular works, public domain titles were 20% more likely to be available. These data suggest that copyright status, in fact, seems to reduce availability, even for the most popular books.\n\n*If the argument for copyright term extension turns on the need for incentives to reproduce older works or create derivative works from them, then existing empirical evidence suggests that term extensions are not needed and are probably counter-productive.\n\n*There is little evidence that public domain books are being over-exploited and worn out due to their unprotected legal status. The average price of recorded books in the full public domain data set and the full copyrighted data set was virtually the same, suggesting that the value of the public domain works in comparison to their copyrighted counterparts had not been destroyed by overuse.\n\n*When consumers go to the three main sources for audiobooks (www.audible.com, Amazon, and Barnes & Nobles), they will likely find that the public domain books are equally well read as the copyrighted books. The data substantially undermines any claims of debasement in the most important market for audiobooks.\n\n*There seems little reason to fear that once works fall into the public domain, their value will be substantially reduced based on the amount or manner in which they are used. There are considerable benefits to users of open access to public domain works. We suspect that these benefits dramatically outweigh the costs.','Policy implications: \n\n*The copyright term extension debate will have substantial consequences for the creative industries and the consuming public. \n\n*If copyrighted works begin once again to enter the public domain, their owners will stand to lose millions of dollars in revenue. \n\n*But that revenue comes directly from consumers’ pockets and the expiration of valuable copyrights saves those consumer costs. \n\n*Perhaps more importantly, those works will be available to an army of creative artists who will be able to use them in their works in ways that were impossible while the works were copyrighted.','http://dx.doi.org/10.2139/ssrn.2130008','http://btlj.org/data/articles2015/vol28/28_1/28-berkeley-tech-l-j-0001-0044.pdf',0,0,0,'For study 1, the authors compiled a list of bestselling novels that were published in the decade before (1913-22) and the decade after (1923-32): the copyright-public domain divide.

National and international legislation, including the Stop Online Piracy Act (SOPA), the PROTECT IP Act (PIPA), and the Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement (ACTA), have generated protests online and in the streets by people who are concerned about the expansion of IP rights. Common to each of these proposals was an expansion in the use of criminal sanctions to deter IP violations. Many copyright owners and the associations that represent them support criminal enforcement of IP, including the use of imprisonment, to combat the threat of increased IP piracy on the internet and throughout a globalized economy. Others, including a heterogeneous coalition of scholars, activists, and internet based companies like Google and Wikipedia, fear that using criminal sanctions to protect IP will expand already overgrown rights and chill valuable expressive and inventive behavior.','Scholars and stakeholders have been wrong to assume that criminal sanctions for IP infringement are justified on economic grounds. It is true that criminal sanctions could play an important role in preventing harmful\nbehavior that cannot be deterred through other means. But imposing criminal sanctions is costly. For patent infringement, the costs of imposing criminal sanctions are very unlikely to exceed its benefits. Civil sanctions will probably be sufficient for creating the optimal amount of infringing behavior. For copyright infringement, civil sanctions alone should be sufficient to deter nearly all types of harmful conduct. There is an economic case for imposing criminal sanctions for copyright infringement only with respect to a discrete set of activities: massive reproduction and sales of commercially valuable works. We have arrived at the conclusion that the case for criminal IP sanctions is weak or nonexistent while putting to one side both noneconomic considerations, such as moral or deontological objections to criminal IP sanctions, and economic concerns about the efficacy of IP in promoting innovation. Once those considerations are added to the calculus, we suspect that the argument for criminal sanctions for IP infringement will disintegrate almost entirely.','Many IP stakeholders and scholars have operated under the assumption that there is an economic case for criminal IP sanctions. Criminal sanctions for IP infringement are thought to be justified by the possibility of deterring or incapacitating would-be infringers. When criminal IP sanctions have been criticized, the criticism has usually come from a normative position outside of economics-moral rights, for instance.\" The economic case for criminal sanctions is usually treated as unassailable. We do not believe that the case for criminal sanctions in IP is nearly as strong as many have treated it. Indeed, we will argue that criminal liability may be justified only in one small corner of IP law, in response to one discrete type of infringement.','http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2297488','http://heinonline.org/HOL/LandingPage?handle=hein.journals/scal87&div=11&id=&page=',1,0,1,'This study compares two systems of copyright enforcement, one with high level of enforcement and the criminalisation of infringement, and one with low enforcement.

Traditional conceptions of the value of IP rely on assumptions about human rationality derived from classical economics. The law assumes that when people make decisions about buying, selling, and licensing IP they do so with fixed, context-independent preferences. Over the past several decades, this rational actor model of classical economics has come under attack by behavioral data showing that people do not always make strictly rational decisions. Perhaps the most important research in this field is that related to the “endowment effect” – the discovery that, contrary to economic predictions, people value the same object more when they own it than when they do not. \n\nTo date, the endowment effect has been observed for a variety of goods including mugs, lottery tickets, and hunting permits. Our experiment establishes a substantial valuation asymmetry between authors of poems and potential purchasers of them. As we explain in detail in the article, we constructed a market for the poems that was modeled on a market for licensing IP. The observed differences in valuation indicate that IP licensing markets may be substantially less efficient that previously believed. Our results suggest that (1) the preferences of IP creators, owners, and purchasers are unstable and dependent on the initial distribution of property rights in creative works, and (2) large gaps arise between purchasers’ willingness to pay and sellers’ willingness to accept even though the poems are non-rival property and the contemplated alienation of the property is therefore only partial. \n\nOur findings suggest that private transactions in creative goods may face significant transaction costs arising from cognitive biases that drive the price that creators and owners of IP are likely to demand for transfers considerably higher than what buyers will, on average, be willing to pay. This does not mean, of course, that transactions in IP will not take place – we see such transactions happening out in the world every day. Our research suggests, however, that IP transactions may occur at a level that is significantly suboptimal, and that the baleful effect of cognitive and affective biases is likely to be more serious for transactions in works of relatively low commercial value, or for which no well-established custom or pattern helps to inform valuation. These results have considerable implications for the structuring of IP rights, IP formalities, IP licensing, and fair use.','* Financial incentives only increased creative output when; individuals where motivated by financial incentive to do closed creative tasks (tasks with a known goal or end) and in a group setting where the group had a common goal (this treatment group mimicked the collective corporate culture).\n\n* In other circumstances like in open creativity tasks (no knows creative target/goal) and when no team incentive were produced for groups the monetary incentives did not increase creative output.\n\n* Also found that men where more likely to take risks than women and wagered more money under know risk (coinflip), however under ambiguous risk (the exact probabilities of were unknown to the test subjects) men and women bet similar amounts to what the women bet under known risk which would suggest men are more averse to ambiguous risk than women.','* Stronger copyright laws do not necessarily increase creative output suggested by the ambiguous results from historical data to increases and decreases in the stregnth of copyright laws.\n* The results showed that programs to induce a more collective corporate atmosphere could be worthwhile, since individuals performed better with financial incentives when there was a collective corporate culture.','http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1568962','http://scholarship.law.cornell.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=3184&context=clr',0,0,0,'The subjects included 207 women and 287 students.

Using firm-level data from Germany we document a positive link between R&D outsourcing and intellectual property infringement. In line with theory we show that this effect varies with the market value of knowledge, and the allocation of property rights. We discuss how outsourcing induced spillovers may foster technology diffusion, affecting industry evolution and market structure.','* The coeﬃcient of large ﬁrms in the invention model is signiﬁcant at the one percent level, indicating that companies with more than 250 employees face a higher likelihood of infringement of technical inventions than medium-sized ﬁrms (50–249 employees). Apart from that, the authors do not ﬁnd huge diﬀerences across size groups. The coeﬃcients of R&D Intensity and % University Degree are only signiﬁcant in the invention model. As expected, diﬀerences between regions are important. Firms in East Germany have a lower risk of imitation throughout all IP categories. The coeﬃcient of Exporter shows the expected positive sign and is signiﬁcant in all speciﬁcations. \n\n* They find considerable diﬀerences between types of industries. Knowledge intensive manufacturing ﬁrms have the highest likelihood of infringement throughout. This is more pronounced concerning infringement of inventions and designs, less so for infringement of products.\n\n* The estimated coeﬃcient of R&D Outsourcing has the expected positive sign in all mod\nels. Much in line with what already saw in the descriptive statistics, the point estimate\nis largest concerning infringement of inventions, smaller concerning infringement of designs\n(this diﬀerence is not signiﬁcant, however), and smallest concerning imitation of products.\nCompared to infringement of inventions, the outsourcing eﬀect is signiﬁcantly smaller (p\nvalue 0.07) concerning infringement of products. This is in line with their expectation that the\ncorrelation between R&D outsourcing and infringement of generic knowledge is stronger than\nthe correlation between R&D outsourcing and infringement of speciﬁc knowledge.','The results suggest that value-appropriation challenges are clearly evident with respect to technical inventions and designs. Thus, in cases where the latter represent critical core knowledge, managers should be cautious when it comes to buying external R&D. At the same time, this suggests that managers can at least partly inﬂuence the imitation risk by contracting out more speciﬁc tasks, that are less easy to transfer into a diﬀerent commercial context. On that note it may also pay out to deﬁne con\ntractual terms which help to ‘artiﬁcially’ increase speciﬁcity. However, sometimes the beneﬁts\nof R&D outsourcing may still prevail. When we think of products as modular combinations\nof early stage R&D, a ﬁrm might proﬁt from external contributors (although under risk of\nloosing control over early stage IP) and simultaneously be able to secure its competitive ad\nvantage on the ﬁnal product market. Clearly specifying the allocation of property rights is not\nonly useful to align incentives, resulting in higher innovation eﬀorts of the vendor (Arora and\nMerges, 2004; Leiponen, 2008), but also reduces the infringement risk. This will be especially\nvaluable for ﬁrms that operate in sectors that have limited access to formal measures of IP\nprotection.','http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0048733314001978','http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0048733314001978',0,0,0,'Our measure of vertical R&D outsourcing is a dummy variable indicating whether ﬁrms have\ncontracted third parties for R&D between 2005 and 2007.

All digital albums are allowed to be copied for personal use, as opposed to CD albums that cannot be copied. \n\n* In spite of this, digital music is associated with a lower price compared to a CD. Whether the lower price depends on the store, on the intangible nature of the product, or on the possibility to copy, cannot be determined due to the lack of variability in the explanatory variables. \n\n* As private copying for personal use is widespread and allowed in the UK, it is plausible that private copying is already largely or fully priced in the UK market. Consumers and producers of music appear to expect that music will be copied for personal non-commercial use and all downloads are sold on these terms.\n\nFilm\n\n* In parallel with traditional films, which come with only one license (e.g. Blu-Ray and DVD), the film industry has found different ways to allow users to have more than one copy of the films they purchase. Examples can be found in the sales of digital films (which could be copied onto a number devices), by bundling multiple formats in the same package (which may also include a complimentary downloadable digital copy), or through new kinds of licenses, such as Ultraviolet. \n\n* The study found a positive relationship between price and film copies. In particular, since different types of formats have different impacts on price, we can conclude that film stores charge users not simply to have more copies, but to have the opportunity to choose from a higher variety of available choices.\n\nBooks\n\n* All the bookstores in the sample allow users to make copies of their eBooks. In particular, the copying terms and conditions are enforced using technologies embedded in the eBooks (DRMs) which are able to limit the number of copies that users is allowed and the kinds of devices in which the eBooks may be read on (e.g. smartphones, tablets, eBook readers). \n\n* The influence of the number of copies allowed and the number of allowable devices on the price could not be determined because (1) of the lack of variability in the explanatory variables, and (2) to the fact that the large majority of price dissimilarities were captured by the difference between traditional books and eBooks. \n\n* However, when considering that they are allowed to be copied, eBooks are on average less expensive than physical books (which are not allowed to be copied). This premium for a physical book is of course likely to be explained by manufacturing costs and the value consumers place on physical features, rather than on the number of copies that can be made from it.\n\nSoftware\n\n* This market case was used partly as a control case as it would notionally not be affected by a private copying exception. However, it is a  sector, which actively tries to price for additional copies. \n\n* The analysis suggests that software producers charge a price that reflects the possibility of making additional copies. In other words, a higher number of copies is associated with an increase in the price.

As\ntelevisions now populate almost every home we would expect this influence to have worked itself out. The 1980\'s have seen the arrival of videos as a new threat to cinema takings. Analysts of the industry have been suggesting (Docherty et. al., 1986), (Variety, 1985) that the threat is more apparent than real with demographic factors and/or poor films being the cause of more recent audience declines. These claims derive from casual inspection of ticket receipts (Variety, 1985) or one-off surveys of consumer attitudes (Docherty et. al., 1986). To date there has been no concrete evidence offered for or against the impact of video. Such evidence is hard to gather because of data limitations.

This paper addresses that question by providing an economic summary of how the markets for music, film and books have changed. Our paper focuses on three industries, music, film and books, where the industry structure evolved under a long-term regime of robust copyright protection. In each industry, we first discuss the stages of the traditional supply chain.\nSecond, we discuss the effects of digitization on that traditional supply chain, focusing on how digitization has radically reduced distribution costs, while simultaneously increasing the potential for piracy of content. Third, we provide a brief history of how new business models for the distribution of content in each industry have fared thus far. Finally, we consider how the intermediaries and the artists are likely to fare under the\nnew regime.','* In all three of these industries, digitization and the internet have led to a precipitous decline in distribution costs, as well as an enormous increase in piracy that has likely diminished the economic rewards afforded by copyright.\n\n* By establishing legal rights to the intellectual content of these works, copyright solves the market failures associated with these public goods. However, this approach works only if producers are able to capture adequate compensation to produce at the socially desirable level. \n\n* If a copyright scheme fails to create enforceable ownership rights, producers of intellectual works will not receive adequate compensation for their initial investment and will therefore face reduced production incentives. This is the situation that digital distribution threatens to create.\n\n* Unless addressed through novel business models, the resultant market failure could require legal innovation (perhaps in the form of compulsory blanket licenses) to ensure that producers have adequate incentive to create original works. \n\n* Each of the three main functions of record companies—finding talent, recording music, and promoting/distributing songs—has been affected by digitization and internet distribution.\n\n* Digitization has had its greatest impact in the post-theatrical release segment of the film industry, which has been dominated by physical DVDs for the past 8 to 10 years. Online distribution of digitized movies has been possible since 1997. Nevertheless, revenues from online distribution have been relatively modest for the past five years due to both low sales volumes and relatively lower prices for online content. \n\n* Online distribution is becoming increasingly important to the industry at the same time that TVs are increasingly integrated with internet connectivity.','The authors conclude with a series of research questions that might be pursued to obtain a better understanding of how these different industries will evolve over time. Here some of them:\n* Will traditional record companies be able to prosper as content-providers rather than distributors?\n* What legal solutions to copyright infringement can the music industry afford to pursue?  \n* Will traditional film studios be able to remain profitable as their power over the distribution function declines?\n* What DRM solutions are available? Which DRMs are most user-friendly? \n* To what extent will consumers view e-books as a substitute for traditional books?\n* Will consumers continue to demand traditional books, say, through Amazon or bookstores?','http://sites.nationalacademies.org/cs/groups/pgasite/documents/webpage/pga_063398.pdf','http://sites.nationalacademies.org/cs/groups/pgasite/documents/webpage/pga_063398.pdf',0,0,0,'The paper analyses three industries and assesses 12 business models suitable for the age of digitisation and internet distribution (6 for music, 3 for movies, 3 for books).'),('Canat,_Guibault_and_Logeais_(2015)','Canat, Guibault and  Logeais (2015)','http://www.copyrightevidence.org/evidence-wiki/index.php/Canat,_Guibault_and_Logeais_(2015)',2015,'Study on Copyright Limitations and Exceptions for Museums','The question addressed in this study is whether the current state of copyright exceptions and limitations in copyright law are fitted so as to enable museums to carry their mandates and if not so, how to ensure that the provision of museum services falling in the scope of their mandates, is not impeded taking account of the interests of all stakeholders. How can the rights holders’ authorization best be ascertained, through the law or through contract? Can the exceptions and limitations in the copyright acts of the Members of the Berne Union be amended to alleviate problems of legal uncertainty?','Legal certainty being the backbone for the development of activities, museums need to have a clear understanding of the rules that apply and should apply to fulfill their mandates which, for the purpose of this Study, are non-commercial as per the ICOM definition.\n\nThe feedback sent by the museums reveals the following main concerns:\n1) Time spent and costs incurred for the completion of a digital inventory and the creation of corresponding databases and for management of rights when mounting exhibitions;\n2) The boundaries of the making available of the collection to the public on their websites, for information, enjoyment and research and study.','Recommendations to the museum community\n\n1. Museums and rightholders should cooperate to ensure that they get a fair return in the subsequent exploitation of the artwork by third party operators.\n\n. Museums should also negotiate with the various stakeholders and in particular with academics, artists and collective management organisations to update licenses and tariffs, to ease the acquisition of permissions and to anticipate new uses that may need authorisation. Joint action of museums would enhance their negotiation position and help draw a blue print where the lawmakers may not have set applicable rules or even figured out the stakes. Statements of the museums community on thumbnail images could provide some guidance, more will be needed with digital humanities and 3D printing as well as with crowdfunding.\n\n3. Cooperation between museums should be encouraged and those more experienced could provide useful guidance to fellow museums through the aegis of ICOM and project partnerships.\n\nRecommendations to the lawmakers\n\n1. Digitization of collections appears to be an inescapable step to fulfill their primary mandates of preservation and communication to the public for information on heritage resources to be visited.\nIn this respect, rules on digitization of artwork held in the permanent collection of a museum, whether or not orphan works, for preservation purposes, could be clarified and harmonized as exceptions or limitations. Digitization of unpublished works could follow the same rule as for orphan works, e.g. prior due diligence to locate rightholders and seek consent and disclosure only for legitimate reasons of public interest. Consultation on museums’ websites (with restricted downloading) of the permanent collections, catalogues and archives could also be addressed as a limitation subject to the rightholder‘s consent and standard compensation.\n\n2. The territoriality of rights and the difficulty associated with clearing rights in different territories is a long-enduring situation, which copyright collective management entities know well. They have indeed entered into reciprocal agreements with sister organisations to ease the licensing of copyright. Still there is no overall licensing framework for international exhibitions and the scope of the required authorisations for digital transmissions is not all that clear: differentiating acts of reproduction and communication to the public is not easy. Furthermore, “communication to the public/ making available” is not explicitly defined in content, location and effect, notably regarding spin off effects on image search services which operate to some extent like image banks and the implications of hyperlinking towards copyrighted works.\n\n3. Education, research and study are often collaborative and cross-border activities. There are Creative Common licenses for these purposes which museums can use for dissemination of their own copyrighted works. Yet, museums should develop their own policy to ensure the terms of a communication of their collections for research and study in accordance with their strategy, the requirement of non-commercial purposes and the development of text and data mining for instance. A minimum set of principles could be retained by ICOM or a group of museums willing to address this challenge.','http://www.wipo.int/edocs/mdocs/copyright/en/sccr_30/sccr_30_2.pdf','http://www.wipo.int/edocs/mdocs/copyright/en/sccr_30/sccr_30_2.pdf',1,0,1,'The 45 member countries with statutory exceptions for museums were analyzed.

The changing face of copyright requires a re-evaluation of the existing norms and theories of copyright as an inanimate phenomenon that is reliant on humans for its adaptations. This article examines authors’ responses to these developments in the context of the philosophical theories underpinning copyright law, current Australian legislative and judicial considerations, and the impact of e-publishing on traditional perceptions of copyright protection. In particular, the article incorporates findings from a research study conducted with Australian authors on their perceptions of the value and meaning of copyright and how these viewpoints affect their creative practice, as well as their ability to deal with digital copyright challenges and publishing opportunities. In taking cognisance of these research results and considering the concurrent evolution of digital copyright models, this article proposes that there is a need to address the tension exhibited between the utilitarian approach, characteristic of Australian copyright law, and the natural rights views of authors, to create a sustainable balance.','* Significantly, more than half of respondents responded negatively to the statement ‘I regard copyright as an incentive to create’. However, just over 60 per cent responded positively to the statement ‘Copyright is a consideration for me when I create’. This figure rose to almost 90 per cent in relation to the following statement: ‘Copyright is a consideration for me when I publish my work’. These responses suggest that most respondents regarded copyright as an important consideration in the publishing process, rather than during the creative process, possibly due to the immediacy of having to deal with this issue in publishing contracts and royalty considerations.\n\n* During the in-depth interviews, the responses appeared to support those generated by the online survey but also further revealed the relationship between authors’ perceptions of copyright and creative expression. Eleven of the interviewees expressed the view that they did not regard copyright as an incentive to create and perceived it as having minimal or no influence in their approach to their work, whereas five respondents said it was an important consideration in their practice. However, five of the negative respondents qualified their answers by adding that, although copyright did not motivate them to write, it was an important issue to be considered once they had created the work. These respondents were emphatic in their viewpoint that copyright afforded them no creative motivation, some authors even expressing surprise at the suggestion. \n\n* Both groups - over 90 per cent of respondents - overwhelmingly agreed that they were ‘mostly motivated by personal satisfaction.’ However, nearly 46 per cent also agreed that they were ‘mostly motivated by achieving recognition’, indicating that there was some overlap in their purpose, with some respondents being equally motivated by personal satisfaction and achieving recognition. A variation in the fulltime and part-time group responses was however evident in relation to financial incentives. Although the majority of authors (83 per cent of part-time and approximately 66 per cent of full-time authors) disagreed that financial gain was their primary incentive, as expected, full-time authors attached more value to financial considerations.','* There is a need to address the tension exhibited between the utilitarian approach characteristic of Australian copyright law, and the natural rights views of authors, to create a sustainable balance.\n\n* Copyright requires a re-assessment in the digital environment. At the very least, Australian publishers and authors should apply close scrutiny to the terms and conditions of international electronic licensing agreements such as Google and Kindle agreements.

But such a debate ignores the effect of copyright law and enforcement on innovation. Even though innovation is the most important factor in economic growth, it is difficult to observe, especially in comparison to copyright infringement.\n\nThis article addresses this problem. It presents the results of a groundbreaking study of 31 CEOs, company founders, and vice-presidents from technology companies, the recording industry, and venture capital firms. Based on in-depth interviews, the article offers original insights on the relationship between copyright law and innovation. It also analyzes the behavior of the record labels when confronted with the digital music revolution. And it traces innovators’ and investors’ reactions to the district court’s injunction in the case involving peer-to-peer (p2p) service Napster.\n\nThe Napster ruling presents an ideal setting for a natural experiment. As the first decision to enjoin a p2p service, it presents a crucial data point from which we can trace effects on innovation and investment. This article concludes that the Napster decision reduced innovation and that it led to a venture capital “wasteland.” The article also explains why the record labels reacted so sluggishly to the distribution of digital music. It points to retailers, lawyers, bonuses, and (consistent with the “Innovator’s Dilemma”) an emphasis on the short term and preservation of existing business models.\nThe article also steps back to look at copyright litigation more generally. It demonstrates the debilitating effects of lawsuits and statutory damages. It gives numerous examples, in the innovators’ own words, of the effects of personal liability. It traces the possibilities of what we have lost from the Napster decision and from copyright litigation generally. And it points to losses to innovation, venture capital, markets, licensing, and the “magic” of music.\nThe story of innovation in digital music is a fascinating one that has been ignored for too long.

Thus, drawing from the organizational literature on innovation we formulate testable propositions that relate organizational factors to artistic innovation. We hope that our focus on organizational factors contributes to a more comprehensive framework on the determinants of artistic innovation in particular and programming in general.','The authors have provided a working definition of artistic innovation. They have reviewed the literature and observed two main theoretical perspectives (economical and sociological) and three levels of explanation (macro, meso and micro), noting that that both theoretical perspectives\ntend to focus on the effect of macro-environmental (demand and supply) and meso (funding mix) factors rather than on organizational ones (such as size, age, structure and power distribution). They also observed that the empirical evidence for both the macro and meso factors is rather mixed and inconclusive and have provided new theoretical propositions about the role of funding mix that take these limitations into account.\nThey also bridged the gap identified in the literature by drawing on the organizational literature on innovation, in a manner consistent with the specific nature of arts organizations, drawing from the behavioral theory of the firm to suggest that the gap between performance and\naspiration levels, together with the availability of slack resources, might drive artistic\ninnovation.

But all too often they find themselves thwarted.\n\nA survey of communication scholars’ practices, conducted by the Ad Hoc Committee on Fair Use and\nAcademic Freedom in the International Communication Association (ICA), reveals that copyright\nignorance and misunderstanding hamper distribution of finished work, derail work in progress, and\nmost seriously, lead communication researchers simply to avoid certain kinds of research altogether.\nNearly half the respondents express a lack of confidence about their copyright knowledge in relation\nto their research. Nearly a third avoided research subjects or questions and a full fifth abandoned\nresearch already under way because of copyright concerns. In addition, many ICA members have\nfaced resistance from publishers, editors, and university administrators when seeking to include\ncopyrighted works in their research. Scholars are sometimes forced to seek copyright holders’\npermission to discuss or criticize copyrighted works. Such permission seeking puts copyright holders\nin a position to exercise veto power over the publication of research, especially research that deals with contemporary or popular media.\n\nThese results demonstrate that scholars in communication frequently encounter confusion, fear, and\nfrustration around the unlicensed use of copyrighted material. These problems, driven largely by\nmisinformation and gatekeeper conservatism, inhibit researchers’ ability both to conduct rigorous\nanalyses and to develop creative methodologies for the digital age.\n\nCommunication scholars can benefit by developing best practices standards for the most ample and\nflexible copyright exemption permitting unlicensed use of copyrighted materials: fair use. While nonU.S. members will not be able to apply this doctrine directly to work done outside the United States, having this interpretation established for U.S. scholars will expand opportunities within a large area of communication research, encourage international scholars to explore their own nations’ copyright exemptions, and provide an important benchmark for non-U.S. scholars looking for models as\ncopyright reform proceeds.','- 387 communications researchers responded to this survey, primarily from the US and Canada.\n\n- The survey indicated heavy reliance on usage of and access to copyrighted works for analyising and criticising: 18 percent for all or nearly all of research; 36 percent for some; 32 percent for a small portion; and 14 percent for none.\n\n- Other uses require regular reproduction of works in communication research, such as showing film clips in experiments.  16 percent of respondents reported using an entire copyrighted work for purposes other than analysis or critique, and they identified uses of copyrighted material as particularly important for research.\n\n- The majority of research rated their knowledge of copyright as \'good\' or better but also actively seek guidance: 15 percent always seek guidance on use of copyrighted material; 24 percent usually; and 37 percent at least occasionally.  Despite these reports, researchers also felt confused about copyright intricacies and fearful use of certain materials could impede work.  \n\n- Thus 31 percent have abandoned a project entirely due to infringement concerns.  Over half of respondents would \'somewhat likely, very likely, or definitely\' undertake a different course of research if copyright were not a concern.\n\n- Despite formalities for copyrighted material, many of the uses of copyrighted material that researchers avoided would have been considered as possible fair use, at least under U.S. law.\n\n- Non-U.S. scholars reported similarly about copyright inhibiting research; however, they were less confident about knowledge of copyright exceptions, were more likely to have received warnings from home institutions about using copyrighted materials, and were more likely to be pursuing a different course of research were it not for copyright infringement concerns.',NULL,'http://cmsimpact.org/sites/default/files/documents/pages/ICA_-_Clipping.pdf',NULL,0,0,0,''),('Centre_for_Intellectual_Property_and_Information_Law_(2006)','Centre for Intellectual Property and Information Law (2006)','http://www.copyrightevidence.org/evidence-wiki/index.php/Centre_for_Intellectual_Property_and_Information_Law_(2006)',2006,'Review of the Economic Evidence Relating to an Extension of the Term of Copyright in Sound Recordings','The aim of this study is to provide the Gowers Review with an independent assessment of the economic evidence bearing on proposals to extend the term of copyright in sound recordings. The issue raised before the Review is whether the term of copyright in sound recordings in the UK (and implicitly this would require an alteration at EU level) should be increased.','* Benefits consist of welfare from new works created because of higher levels of expected revenue under the longer term. Costs consist of the increased deadweight losses stemming from restricted access to existing and future work due to the extension.\n\n* Investment in current artists should be based upon the prospects of profits, not the availability of past ones. Therefore retrospective term increases will have no effect upon the creation of new work.\n\n* Extension will increase the net present value of revenues for new works by 1% or less. While some authors argue that this small increase might, in some circumstances, result in a disproportionate reaction, nothing in the empirical evidence suggests that this is the case as regards current levels of production in the record industry.\n\n* Given the small size of this increase, the large number of works already being produced and the likely size of the deadweight loss (particularly in relation to historical works) it is our view that a term extension will likely result in a net loss to UK society as a whole.\n\n* Increasing copyright term increases revenues to the record industry. For retrospective extensions the 2% increase in the present value of revenues (being approximately 160 million pounds) suggested by PwC would seem plausible while for prospective extensions the figure would likely be 1% or lower. \n\n* Existing literature gives little indication as to how revenues would be distributed however our research did indicate that featured recording artists would likely benefit to some extent from such an extension with typical royalties rates around 5–15%.\n\n* Existing economic theory plausibly suggests that the extension of copyright term increases costs to consumers (consumers should be construed in a wide sense to include all users of recorded music including bars, film-makers, broadcasters etc). While the immediate cost of prospective extension is likely to be small, the immediate cost of an extension applied to existing works would likely be significant.\n\n* Increasing copyright term in the UK from 50 to 70 (or 95 years) is likely to have a significant, negative effect, on balance of trade.\n\n* The theoretical arguments that some incentive is required to induce publication, archiving and preservation activities in relation to old works seem to us to be plausible. However the review does not find that the need for such incentives would justify giving existing copyright holders an extended term of protection in the original work.\n\n* Modern systems of law regard the protection of established rights as fundamental. That is, once granted, modern legal systems rarely reduce existing entitlements. The effect of the principle of respect for established rights is that it is much easier to extend copyright term than to reduce it (so much so that term extensions are likely to be \'irreversible\'). \n\n* If term were not extended and research over the next ten years showed this lack of extension to have been a mistake then it would be relatively easy to correct this error by introducing a term extension.','\"Any decision to extend term should be based on stronger evidence than one to keep term at its current level.\"\n\n\"Secondly, the prudent policy-maker faced with uncertainty should prefer a course of inaction so as to keep options open and await better and more precise data.

The investigation reveals several important findings. First, cluster analysis results show that Chinese computer users can be divided into four ethical ideology types(i.e., situationists, absolutists, subjectivists, and exceptionists) reasonably consistent with Forsyth’s taxonomy. Second, when compared with situationists, absolutists, and exceptionists, subjectivists are found to have the least unfavourable attitude towards software piracy and are most frequently engaged in software piracy. Third, Chinese computer users’ ideological relativism exerts a stronger influence on their software piracy attitude and behaviour than does their ideological idealism. The findings suggest that the government, and authentic software developers and vendors should focus on subjectivists as their target audience of anti-software piracy communications. These policy makers and practitioners should also make concerted efforts to help subjectivists better realise how their software piracy act may damage parties ‘proximate’ to themselves so as to lower the rate of software piracy.','There were 5 hypothesis\' tested in this paper:\nAmong Chinese computer users adhering to different ethical ideologies (i.e., situationists, absolutists, subjectivists, and exceptionists)...\n# Absolutists will exhibit the least favourable attitude towards software piracy (H1a), and be least frequently engaged in software piracy (H1b).\n# Subjectivists will exhibit the most favourable attitude towards software piracy (H2a), and be most frequently engaged in software piracy (H2b).\n# When compared with Chinese computer users adhering to the situationist ethical ideology type, those adhering to the exceptionist ethical ideology type will exhibit a more favourable attitude towards software piracy (H3a), and be more frequently engaged in software piracy (H3b).\n# Relativism rather than idealism exerts a stronger influence on Chinese computer users’ software piracy attitude and behaviour.\n# Chinese computer users’ software piracy attitude is positively related to their software piracy behaviour\n\nResults:\n* Both situationists and absolutists (rather than just absolutists) exhibited similar levels of unfavourable attitudinal and behavioural responses towards software piracy.\n* Subjectivists held the most favourable attitudinal and behavioural responses towards software piracy.\n* Exceptionalists had more favourable software piracy attitude and more frequent software piracy behaviour compared with situationists.\n* Relativism and idealism exerted a significant direct effect on software piracy behaviour, a comparison of the two relevant standardised regression estimates indicated that relativism was far more influential than idealism.\n* The findings suggest a significant influence of software piracy attitude on the corresponding behaviour.','The findings also help policy makers, and genuine (mostly foreign) software developers and vendors to better understand the ethical reasoning of Chinese software pirates and ultimately devise more effective measures to combat their wrongdoing.','http://www.google.co.uk/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=2&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=0CCsQFjAB&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.researchgate.net%2Fpublication%2F220393033_Does_ethical_ideology_affect_software_piracy_attitude_and_behaviour_An_empirical_investigation_of_computer_users_in_China&ei=Sy1jVeLdI-mK7QaGgoGADA&usg=AFQjCNGIGeAZkdEHmId36myBPca5lMtJRA&bvm=bv.93990622,d.ZGU',NULL,0,0,0,'Overall, 57% of the 266 respondents were male and 40% of the respondents were unmarried. 90% of the respondents reported that they had access to computers and the Internet at home while 70% of the respondents were working adults, 28% were students, and 2% were either retirees or unemployed.

It aims to make the framework useful in particular in the assessment of the merits of current claims for changes to the scope of exceptions. These calls for changes have recently become louder in light of technology improvements. The improvements allow for new channels of distribution and for new uses of creative work. They also reduce the cost of copying and affect transactions costs. With these changes taking place, changes in the scope of exceptions may be required.','*Exceptions are likely to be justified when transaction costs prevent mutually beneficial trade. In the extreme, this a case of missing markets. Some existing exceptions, like the citation exception, seem to be at least in part motivated by such considerations.  \n*In the view of technological advances, which allow for new modes of exploitation of creative works, calls for new exceptions have been made. Besides enabling new modes of exploitation and use of creative work, technological advances may also result in a reduction in transaction costs.\n*Assuming that markets for creative works exist but that the rightholders possess market power – which may result in a deadweight loss and which could potentially be curbed by broader exceptions – it cannot be at present established on the basis of the economic theory alone whether exceptions should be narrowed or broadened in response to a reduction of the cost of making copies of creative works (brought about by technological advances). Furthermore, it cannot be established at present on the basis of theory alone whether exceptions should be broadened or narrowed down as a consequence of the expansion of the consumption possibilities of creative material (again brought about by technological advances). Nevertheless, there may be a case for exceptions in particular when they allow for the development of product qualities that a copyright owner could not produce herself due to transaction costs and technological constraints. Exceptions are also more likely justified in circumstances where hold-up problem risks introducing dynamic inefficiencies (in terms of suppressing incentives to invest).\n*Externalities potentially introduce a case for exceptions.  The implementation of certain exceptions meant to solve problems due to transaction costs or externalities may run into difficulty when the dissemination and efficient access to the work requires some effort on the part of the right’s owner. It is then worth asking whether some market mechanism, or an alternative intervention cannot overcome the problems associated with externalities.','* Technological advances have resulted in a reduction of the costs of authorized and unauthorized copying, a reduction of certain categories of transaction costs, and in opportunities for new uses of creative work. Against this backdrop, calls for new (broader) exceptions have been made; but suggestions that in fact fewer (narrower) exceptions are needed have been made as well. Copyright commentators, stakeholders with opposing interests, policy makers and academics have sometimes taken partial and diametrically opposing views in the debate.\n* Absent clearly identified and persistent market inefficiencies, exceptions are not likely to be warranted from an economic perspective.\n* Policy-makers should take a cautious approach when considering introducing new exceptions for such reasons: the market power of rightholders is limited by the inherent limitations in the scope (and length) of copyright protection and the availability of substitute creative work; and positive externalities may easily be exaggerated. Furthermore, with technological advances rightholders may increasingly be able to efficiently offer different, inferior versions of copyrighted work, obviating the rationale for the users to “self-produce” them. This means that the social loss due to market power, externalities, or productive inefficiencies, may not be as large as to justify the social costs of exceptions.\n* Social costs of exceptions predominantly manifest themselves in the form of reduced incentives for creative work and in the form of reduced incentives of the rightholders and distributors to provide access to existing and new work efficiently. Moreover, exceptions may stall the development of future efficient markets which technological advances may soon enable. Clearly, besides the potential benefits, the policy maker will have to consider the likelihood and the economic significance of these costs in the assessment of new exceptions.','http://ec.europa.eu/internal_market/copyright/docs/studies/131001-study_en.pdf','http://ec.europa.eu/internal_market/copyright/docs/studies/131001-study_en.pdf',0,0,0,'Economic analysis of EU copyright exceptions in light of public policy.'),('Charles_River_Associates_(2014)','Charles River Associates (2014)','http://www.copyrightevidence.org/evidence-wiki/index.php/Charles_River_Associates_(2014)',2014,'Economic Analysis of the Territoriality of the Making Available Right in the EU','In the European Union, the protection of copyright and related rights is territorial in the sense that these rights are provided by national laws and their geographical scope is limited to the territory of the state granting them. As a result, enforcement of rights occurs\non a country-by-country-basis. With respect to online on-demand uses of their creative works, authors of music and audiovisual works as well as holders of related rights enjoy an exclusive right of making their works available online to the public “in such a way that members of the public can access them from a place and at a time individually chosen by them”. In practice, online on-demand services also often involve a relevant act of reproduction of copyright protected works which entails the clearance of a second type of right, namely the reproduction right.\n\nSome stakeholders have suggested that the current copyright regime makes the clearance of rights for cross-border online uses an unnecessarily complex as well as resource-consuming process. Multinational service providers indeed often have to negotiate required rights separately for several territories since licensing content on a territory-by-territory basis (territorial licensing) appears to be a common practice in Europe. This arguably raises barriers to cross-border online access and prevents the online sphere from realising the full economic potential associated with the borderless nature of the internet.\n\nIn this report, we take territorial licensing as consisting of rightholders exercising the territorial nature of copyright by limiting the geographical scope of the rights granted to  licensee to a proper subset of EU Member States within a particular transaction. In line with this definition, the territorial nature of copyright is in itself not a sufficient condition for territorial licensing to take place. Indeed, the decisions of licensors to restrict the geographical scope of licences (i.e. to license on a territory-by-territory basis), are based on private motivations and depend on the wider institutional context, not only on the territorial nature of copyright. This report analyses the private motivations underlying the choice of territorial licensing in the current institutional framework in order, in a nutshell, to answer the following question: would a limitation to the practice of territorial licensing improve social welfare? The report focuses on two kinds of copyright-protected works, recorded music and audiovisual works.','* The study identifies several key mechanisms through which the proposed scenarios are likely to affect total welfare. These mechanisms can be broadly categorised into three groups: (1) the use of vertical agreements to affect the interaction between parties within the vertical supply chain and between vertical supply chains, (2) price discrimination and (3) transaction costs.\n\n* Territorial licensing, as an instance of vertical agreements, could generate efficiencies by allowing the parties in vertical relationships to control for harmful externalities. However, it could also be used anti-competitively. The scope for efficiencies would appear to be significant in the relevant industries, and potential harmful effects, while possible, do not appear to be systemic. Therefore, policy changes which reduce the effectiveness of territorial licensing entail a risk of undermining the associated efficiencies which do not appear to be justified by the possibility to reduce the risk of harm.\n\n* Regarding price discrimination, our analysis suggests that there are potential benefits to static welfare that might flow from the proposed policy changes. However, we also find that, in scenarios which limit the ability to restrict territorial scope of licences, dynamic effects would likely negatively affect total social welfare. Our analysis suggests that, due to the importance of sunk costs in both the music and the audiovisual industries and due to the short life of these products, the weight put on preserving the dynamic incentives to invest in the production of creative content should be significant. Price discrimination in the audiovisual and music industries might then well be efficient overall. \n\n* It may indeed well be that the increase in transaction costs which results from territorial fragmentation of rights is an unavoidable side-effect of efficient licensing practices. A careful examination of the determinants of transaction cost reveals, perhaps counterintuitively, that some of the analysed policy changes designed to promote multi-territorial exploitation of content might result in an increase in transaction costs in comparison to the Status Quo. This is because in some of the scenarios legal and/or business uncertainty would likely increase.\n\n* The analysis of the four hypothetical scenarios favours the introduction of the country of origin principle while preserving the freedom of contracting (Scenario 2). This scenario could indeed reduce transaction costs while preserving the ability of the stakeholders to limit the territorial scope of their licences through appropriate contractual clauses. However, such conclusion is subject to a few important caveats.','The authors state  that changes to the licensing model could likely be adopted in response to the reform of the copyright framework and that such changes may also deny the gains that policy-makers hoped to achieve.\nHowever, they state that theory alone is unlikely to give strong predictions and that the relevant mechanisms discussed under the headings of Vertical Agreements and Price Discrimination often have ambiguous effect. Nevertheless, it can inform us about the sources of risks and potential benefits associated with the different policy options.','http://ec.europa.eu/internal_market/copyright/docs/studies/1403_study1_en.pdf','http://ec.europa.eu/internal_market/copyright/docs/studies/1403_study1_en.pdf',0,0,0,'Theoretical economic analysis of the effects of deviation from the Status Quo to create hypothetical Scenarios, focussing on overall social welfare from adjusting mechanisms affecting vertical supply chains, price discrimination and transaction costs.'),('Charness_and_Daniela_(2014)','Charness and Daniela (2014)','http://www.copyrightevidence.org/evidence-wiki/index.php/Charness_and_Daniela_(2014)',2014,'Creativity and Financial Incentives','Creativity is a complex and multi-dimensional phenomenon with tremendous \neconomic importance.

Two factors, cost savings from CD purchase and the low moral reasoning ability of Internet users, have been frequently attributed as rationales for this behavior. Music download, however, can also be interpreted as a value maximizing behavior that chooses between the values from consuming illicit and legitimate music, wherein the consumption value is partly dependent on one’s degree of fashion involvement since music is fashionable. This paper presents a conceptual model of music download by looking at and integrating these seldom noticed perspectives with traditional explanations. An analysis of 834 samples drew from a survey of P2P users in Taiwan reveals that: people are maximizing value while downloading music; and that fashion involvement influences the perception of consumption value from music download. This study also found that moral reasoning moderate the relationships among fashion involvement, consumption value, and behavioral intention to download music.','The authors have extracted three primary findings that may contribute to our knowledge regarding the behavioral intention to download music:\n\n* First of all, consumers are essentially value maximizers when choosing between buying and downloading music. A positive value from downloading music will facilitate music download, and a comparison of the consumption value between the two ways for getting music positively influence users’ behavioral intention.\n\n* Secondly, music download may not be perceived as a problem of ethics. The moral reasoning ability is not related with the behavioral intention to download music files. Downloading music files, though illegal, therefore is probably deemed not so unethical under the ideology of freeware.\n\n* Thirdly, fashion involvement plays an important role in shaping an individual’s intention to download. People who highly involve with fashion will download music files because this behavior is viewed as a symbol of new life style.','Simply proclaiming intellectual property rights and the norm of anti-piracy may be ineffective for diminishing unauthorized music download.

In de ciding on policy, the government must consider how the publisher adjusts price and detection to changes in the fine, tax, and subsidy. Our key welfare result is that increases in detection affect welfare more negatively than price cuts. We also show that the tax is welfare superior to the fine, and that a subsidy is optimal. Generally, government policies that focus on penalties alone will miss the social welfare optimum.','We derived three welfare results. Our key result is that, whereas the producer of an information good may view pricing and enforcement as substitutes in its strategy, the two variables have quite different welfare implications. By reducing the expected benefit among those who copy, an increase in detection imposes greater social losses than a price cut. Accordingly, society prefers that information goods producers man age piracy through price cuts rather than enforcement.\nOur second result is that, if copying occurs, then a tax on the copying medium is welfare superior to a fine on individuals who are detected to have made copies. The tax has less effect on the legitimate price and encourages the publisher to reduce spending on detection. Our final result is that it is optimal to sub sidize legitimate purchases. Besides stimulating usage, the subsidy leads the publisher to reduce spending on detection.

An increasing of the speed of internet and the high technologies of digital compression are factors that made a digital piracy happen easily. Moreover, the lower cost of hi-speed internet is the incentive of the software and digital media piracy occurrences. This is only one of many reasons which cause digital piracy. As Thailand was ranked 13th in the most software piracy in the world in 2003, there are a lot of concerns about the high increasing of the digital piracy in Thailand. This study focuses on one of the digital piracy model, and uses The Theory of Planned Behavior (TPB) as a based theory to determine the factors influencing software and digital piracy. Attitude, Subjective norms and Perceived Behavioral Control are the factors described in TPB as they affect to the intention to create the behavior. Past Behavior is another factor added in this study apart from TPB, which has an impact to the piracy intention. The digital piracy behavior model was developed in this study, and the five hypotheses were proposed. A survey is used to collect data for testing the constructs of the research. Almost four hundred people in Thailand were asked to answer the questionnaire which was developed from an effective guideline to examine the constructs in TPB. Attitude, subjective norms, perceived behavioral control and past behavior were found significantly to be predictors of digital piracy intention. Moreover, the digital piracy intention was a greatest determinant of digital piracy behavior as described in TPB. The implication of this study is to identify the digital piracy factors which relate to people\'s behavior and to model the digital piracy behavior framework for better understanding of digital piracy behavior.

This paper explores DVD piracy in particular, and focuses on identifying different types of pirating behaviour and the antecedents to this behaviour. Four distinct types of ‘pirates’ were identified, based on a cross-sectional sample of UK adults. These groups were serious pirates (‘Devils’), opportunists (‘Chancers’), receivers (‘Receivers’) and non-pirates (‘Angels’). A structural equation modelling approach was used to establish the importance of key antecedents for the overall sample and the four sub groups. The base model fitted the overall sample very well as for the sub group ‘Chancers’, but as expected, there were significant differences in model fit and the importance of key variables between the different behaviour types. The construct of ‘perceived harm’ emerged as an important differentiator in all models. The results suggest that targeting anti-pirating measures specifically at different types of behaviour and their antecedents may increase the effectiveness of such measures and also assist with the efficient allocation of limited resources in this area.','* Four different types of pirating behavior occur: (1) angels (22%), who are not a threat; (2) receivers (27%), who do not actively pirate themselves but do not mind passively receiving pirated content; (3) chancers (23%), who use an opportunity to and pirate when they see it, but do not engage in this behavior frequently; (4) devils (largest group at 29%), who are the most active pirates, see no harm no their behavior, and are not affected by ethical considerations. \n* Ethical considerations and crime perception do not seem to be important considerations when pirating behavioral is considered, as the relationship is only marginally significant. Most people do not view pirating as an ethical issue. \n* Perceived harm has the strongest impact on behavioral intentions, both for the overall sample and for all groups (except for the angels), and overall there is a strong perception that pirating does not cause any harm. \n* The nature of this research suggested that the attitudinal constructs are interlinked: the perception of harm caused by pirating and ethical considerations are interlinked, and with concepts of fair price, and perceived harm and perceived value are related.','* Since perceived harm was the most important contributor to pirating intentions, one of the key objectives for the film industry has to be to raise awareness of the true damage that piracy causes.

Our results on the motives for patent indicate that firms patent for reasons that often extend beyond directly profiting from a patented innovation through either its commercialization or licensing. In addition to the prevention of copying, the most prominent motives for patenting include the prevention of rivals from patenting related inventions (i.e., \"patent blocking\"), the use of patents in negotiations and the prevention of suits. We find that firms commonly patent for different reasons in \"discrete\" product industries, such as telecommunications equipment or semiconductors.

Action is now required at EU level because revenue achieved with online content\nservices in the US in 2004 was almost eight times higher than online content revenue\nproduced in Western Europe. As music pervades European culture and society, only music\nhas the real potential to kick-start online content services.\nThis Study examines the present structures for cross-border collective management of\ncopyright for the provision of online music services. It concludes that the absence of EU-wide\ncopyright licences for online content services makes it difficult for these music services to take\noff. Improving cross-border licensing for music services requires the creation of entirely new\nstructures for cross-border collective management of copyright.\nIn order to improve cross-border management of copyright, this Study considers three\noptions: (1) Do nothing (Option 1); (2) Suggest ways in which cross-border cooperation\nbetween national collecting societies in the 25 Member States can be improved (Option 2); or\n(3) Give right-holders the choice to authorise a collecting society of their choice to manage\ntheir works across the entire EU (Option 3).','The Study concludes that Option 3 offers the most effective model for cross-border\nmanagement.

The aim of the Directive was to remove existing differences in the legal protection of databases by harmonising the rules that applied to copyright protection, safeguard the investment of database makers and ensure that the legitimate interests of users to access information compiled in databases were secured.\n\nAt the time of its adoption, the Commission reasoned that differences in the standard of\n“originality” required for a database to enjoy copyright protection impeded the free movement\nof “database products” across the Community. In particular, the Commission argued that the\ndifference between the lower “sweat of the brow” copyright standard (i.e. involving\nconsiderable skill, labour or judgment in gathering together and/or checking a compilation)\nthat applied in common law Member States and the higher “intellectual creation” standard\nthat applied in droit d’auteur Member States created distortion of trade in “database\nproducts”.\n\nIn essence, the Directive sought to create a legal framework that would establish the ground\nrules for the protection of a wide variety of databases in the information age. It did so by\ngiving a high level of copyright protection to certain databases (“original” databases) and a\nnew form of “sui generis” protection to those databases which were not “original” in the sense\nof the author\'s own intellectual creation (“non-original” databases).\nThe approach chosen in the Directive was to harmonise the threshold of “originality”. Those\n“non-original” databases that did not meet the threshold would be protected by a newly\ncreated right.\n– In a first step, this was done by adopting the higher standard that applied in droit d’auteur\ncountries, which had the effect of protecting fewer databases by copyright (which was now\nlimited to so-called “original” databases);\n– In a second step, for those databases that would previously have enjoyed protection under\nthe “sweat of the brow” copyright, but no longer according to the harmonised “originality”\nstandard, a new right was created – the “sui generis” right to prevent extraction and reutilisation of the whole or a substantial part of the contents of a database in which there\nhas been substantial investment (“non-original” databases).\n\nWhile “original” databases require an element of “intellectual creation”, “non-original”\ndatabases are protected as long as there has been “qualitatively or quantitatively a substantial\ninvestment in either the obtaining, verification or presentation of the contents” of a database.\nThe “sui generis” right is a Community creation with no precedent in any international\nconvention. No other jurisdiction makes a distinction between “original” and “non-original”\ndatabases.','The economic impact of the “sui generis” right on database production is unproven. Introduced to stimulate the production of databases in Europe, the new instrument has had no proven impact on the production of databases. Data taken from the GDD (see Section 4.2.3) show that the EU database production in 2004 has fallen back to pre-Directive levels: the number of EU-based database “entries” into the GDD6 was 3095 in 2004 as compared to 3092 in 1998. In 2001, there were 4085 EU-based “entries” while in 2004 there were only 3095.\n\nIs “sui generis” protection therefore necessary for a thriving database industry? The empirical\nevidence, at this stage, casts doubts on this necessity. The European publishing industry, which was consulted in a restricted online survey, however produced strong submissions arguing that “sui generis” protection was crucial to the continued success of their activities. In addition, most respondents to the on-line survey (see Section 4.2.2) believe that the “sui generis” right has brought about legal certainty, reduced the costs associated with the protection of databases, created more business opportunities and facilitated the marketing of databases.\n\nAt this stage, the evaluation concludes that repealing the Directive altogether or repealing the\n“sui generis” right in isolation would probably lead to considerable resistance by the EU\ndatabase industry which wishes to retain “sui generis” protection for factual compilations.  However, The paper also concludes that leaving the Directive unchanged is an additional policy option for the Commission.','Policy options include: 1) repeal the whole Directive; 2) withdraw the sui generis right; 3) amend the sui generis protections; or 4) maintain the status quo.

The research project focused on copyright law and the digitisation of CHIs’ collections. The digitisation of Māori cultural heritage adds another dimension to the activities of New Zealand CHIs, and this area was also explored in the interviews. \n\nThe objectives of CHIs are to protect, preserve, and facilitate accessibility to cultural entities in the interests of research and education, and the general public interest in cultural matters. In line with overseas practice, New Zealand’s CHIs make use of digital technologies to achieve their objectives. However, many items in CHIs’ collections are protected by copyright. To make a copy of such items without the consent of the copyright owner is an infringement of copyright. Nevertheless, for various reasons including those that are linked to copyright law itself, as well as practical matters such as inadequate resourcing for CHIs to trace absent copyright owners, and a lack of metadata relating to some items in CHIs’ collections, most digitisation projects in CHIs proceed without the consent of copyright owners. Indeed, there is very little understanding within CHIs of the complexities of copyright law and how it relates to the practices of digitisation of their collections. \n\nIn essence, the permitted exceptions in the Copyright Act 1994 (“the Copyright Act”) which are intended to support the preservation and archiving of cultural heritage (“the archiving exceptions”) are, similarly to equivalent provisions in overseas copyright legislation, unsuitable in a digital environment. For example, the archiving exceptions permit a single digital copy of an item to be made, whereas digitisation inevitably results in multiple copies. In addition, it is unclear whether the archiving exceptions apply to CHIs that are museums. \n\nIn part, this gap between practice and law appears to exist because the broader purposes of digitisation of CHI collections were misconceived by the legislators. This research found that CHIs digitise their collections because they wish to provide accessibility to a more widespread audience. Conversely, the archiving exceptions have been drafted with a view that the main purpose of digitisation is similar to that of analogue reproduction; that is, to preserve a copy of an item in a collection that is in danger of deterioration. \n\nAnother reason for the inadequacy of the archiving exceptions is that, as for all permitted exceptions in national copyright laws, these provisions are required to comply with each of the “three step test” provisions in Article 13 of the Agreement of Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (“the TRIPS Agreement”). Part 8 of this report suggests that the three step test requirement can be satisfied while nevertheless providing more appropriate exceptions for CHIs. \n\nWhile CHIs’ practices in the area of digitisation of Māori cultural heritage appear, on the whole, to be robust this report proposes that to provide certainty a new provision to regulate this activity should be inserted into the Copyright Act. The report concludes by recommending further amendments to the Copyright Act to address the current gap between practice and the law that has been revealed by the research.','The objectives of CHIs are to protect, preserve, and facilitate accessibility to cultural entities in the interests of research and education, and the general public interest in cultural matters.\nIn line with overseas practice, New Zealand’s CHIs make use of digital technologies to achieve their objectives.

Section 50 should clarify the position of museums vis a vis the archiving exceptions. Of those participants who had heard of the archiving exceptions, most believed that they do not apply to museums.\n\n2. Amend section 55 (3) to:\n*  permit the making of multiple digital copies of all items in a CHI’s collection, apart from those items regarding which the copyright owner has clearly stated in writing that the item is not to be digitised.\n* require CHIs to remove any item from their website upon request from its copyright owner. No damages should be payable to a copyright owner in any such case apart from where the CHI unreasonably refuses to take down an item.\n* require CHIs to consult with Māori before digitising and providing online public accessibility to cultural heritage originating from Māori. An assessment of the balance between the public interest in culture versus the owners’ rights in their property should also be required.\n\n3. Section 55(3) (a)-(d) should be repealed. In a digital environment each of these requirements is meaningless. Furthermore these requirements bear no relation to the practices and policy objectives of CHIs.\n\n4. New s 55A should be inserted to permit format shifting of archival copies by CHIs.\nThis will alleviate the ongoing problem of obsolescence of computer platforms, programming languages and hardware and will ensure that archives of cultural heritage works remain accessible.\n\n5. Section 56A (1)(d) should be repealed. There is no logical reason to limit the numbers of users who can access a lawfully made digital copy of a work in a CHI’s collection at any one time.\n\n6. Orphan works provisions for CHIs are urgently required and will be achieved by the proposed amendments to s 55(3) above.

Thus, of the 188 countries, 32 have no library exception in their domestic copyright statutes. These basic statistics suggest strongly that exceptions for libraries and archives are fundamental to the structure of copyright law throughout the world, and that the exceptions play an important role in facilitating library services and serving the social objectives of copyright law. The most common subject matter of the statutes is making copies (usually single copies) of works for readers, researchers, and other library users, and making copies for preservation of materials in the collections. Almost as frequently, countries have enacted statutes authorizing libraries to make copies for replacement of works that have suffered damage or loss.\n\nThese three topics long have been a mainstay of library exceptions, but recent years have brought revisions that reflect changing needs and new technologies. Most significantly, the European Union adopted a 2001 directive that authorized member countries to make digitized copies of works available to users on the premises of the library for research and study. That provision has been adopted in many of the European countries, and analogous statutes have been made a part of domestic law in countries beyond the E.U. On the other hand, relatively few countries have enacted truly distinctive law that breaks from various trends in lawmaking to address newly emerging problem areas at the border between copyright and digital technologies. Among the countries that have enacted extensive and original statutes in recent years are Canada, the Russian Federation, and the United Kingdom.\n\nWhile few countries have enacted comparable major changes, at any given time many countries are either revising their library exceptions or adopting entirely new copyright acts. Indeed, Mauritius and Seychelles adopted wholly new copyright acts in 2014. Revisions of selected copyright statutes have occurred during just the last several months in numerous European countries and in Canada, Mexico, Peru, and Singapore. Research on worldwide copyright developments is a dynamic pursuit.','* Main results of the study are presented in comparative chart form.\n\n* Copyright statutes also reflect the tension that can exist among a country’s competing objectives. The details of the library exceptions reveal much about the relationship of copyright law to library services. They also can manifest a compromise among cultural, historical, and economic objectives, typically by permitting libraries to make socially beneficial uses of copyrighted works, while setting limits and conditions aimed at protecting the interests of copyright owners, publishers, and other rightsholders.

This study examines factors, which could determine an individual’s intention to pirate digital material (software, media, etc.). Past piracy behavior and moral obligation, in addition to the prevailing theories of behavior (Theory of Planned Behavior), were studied to determine the influence on digital piracy intention. Based on the results of this study, planned behavioral factors in addition to past piracy behavior and moral obligation were found to influence an individual’s intention to pirate digital material. Attitude, past piracy behavior, perceived behavior control, and moral obligation explained 71 percent of the intention to pirate variance. Using these results, a better understanding of why individuals pirate is presented and can be used to help combat digital piracy.','Using the components of attitude, perceived behavioral control, moral obligation, and past piracy behavior to structure this model, the study found that:\n\n*Past piracy behavior had the greatest effect on the intention to pirate. This suggests that subjects who have previously pirated digital material have a higher intention to pirate in the future, especially as the frequency of pirating increases. 76.5% of the subjects in this study have previously pirated. \n\n*The differences between males and females subjects with respect to past piracy behavior is noted. Of those who have not pirated digital material, 36.4% were men and 63.6% were women. Of those who have pirated digital material in the past, 65.1% were men and 34.9% were women. \n\n*Moral obligation also had a large effect on the intention to pirate digital material. Subjects who felt more guilt or moral obligation toward digital piracy have a lower intention to pirate. 50.7% of the subjects felt more guilt or moral obligation that pirating was not right, while 23.6% felt pirating was alright and acceptable behavior. \n\n*When comparing men and women, both groups felt that pirating was not right (54% and 46.5%, respectively).\n\n*Perceived behavioral control (PBC) also had an effect on the intention to pirate. Subjects who have the skills and resources to pirate digital media have a higher intention of pirate digital media. 84.3% of the subjects reported that it was easy or very easy to pirate digital media, and only 0.3% found it hard or very hard to pirate. In response to this high PBC, it is also interesting to note that the music and movie industries have been making pirating much more difficult to accomplish.\n\n*Attitude was not the best predictor of intention in terms of explained variance (as was the case in previous studies). This could be a result of the high correlation between attitude and moral obligation (r = 0.6481). \n\n*43.9% of the subjects indicated a more favorable attitude toward digital piracy, while 23.6% had a less favorable attitude and 32.5% neutral. \n\n*It is also noted that subjective norms was not significant in the extended TPB piracy intention model.','Potential policy implications: \n\n*Given that subjects believed that it was very easy to pirate digital material, as indicated by the PBC score, one method of prevention could be new technologies such as Digital Rights Management (DRM), which are already being implemented by many companies to control the distribution and use of their digital material (Sundararajan, 2004).\n\n*The subjects in this study also believed that they had the resources necessary to pirate digital material. CD burners are available at very reasonable prices and blank CDs are even cheaper than computer floppy disks. One option is to increase the cost/supply of these resources needed for piracy. By increasing the cost of piracy and decreasing the cost of the digital material, digital piracy can be combated effectively.\n\n*Since students have access to high-speed internet at their universities, a complete Hollywood movie can be downloaded in less than 30 minutes. Many universities are now employing high-end firewalls to prevent the illegal trading of digital media. The next step would be to target ISPs and software makers (that create these file-swapping programs) to curb digital piracy.\n\n*Many subjects didn’t feel a great deal of guilt about pirating digital media; that it was acceptable behavior. There was a low level of guilt (moral obligation) towards digital piracy. To combat this, society has to be informed of how harmful piracy is. One method is the use of targeted ads like the ones targeting smoking in young teenagers. \n\n*Another method is the use of advertisements in movie theatres explaining how piracy affects the motion picture industry as well as individuals that are a part of the industry. Different harmful aspects of piracy should be presented to consumers in the public opinion court. Examples of appropriate behavior must be emphasized. \n\n*Another way would be to enforce newer ethical codes of conduct for information systems professional that stress different types of piracy (not just software) and its effect on business and society as a whole.','http://philpapers.org/rec/CROFTI','http://link.springer.com.ezproxy.lib.gla.ac.uk/article/10.1007/s10551-007-9366-8',0,0,0,'The  sample  for  this  study  is  based  on  a  student sample from a business college at a university in the Midwest.

The psychological determinants of music piracy behaviour were modeled in part with (1991) Ajzen’s theory of planned behaviour. The results show that the intention to swap music on-line depended on one’s attitude toward music piracy, one’s perception that important others want that this behaviour be performed, and one’s perceived competency in doing so. In addition, having swapped music on-line in the past had a strong influence on one’s intention to do it again. Contrary to expectations, the anti-piracy arguments had no significant impact on the behavioural dynamics underlying on-line music piracy.','The framework presented in the article adds two variables to the original theory of planned behavior (Ajzen,2002), i.e., past behaviour and ethical predispositions, as well as some mediating effects, and it argues that: \n\n*The decision to engage in the illegal action of swapping music is founded on one’s attitude toward music piracy, one’s perception that important others want him or her to do so, and one’s perceived capabilities to actually perform this behaviour. \n\n*Having swapped music in the past appears to exert a strong influence on one’s intention to do it again.\n\n*The more a person thinks that music piracy is a normal, habitual behaviour, the more favourable his or her attitude toward this behaviour, and the greater the likelihood of engaging again in this behaviour.\n\n*This article also shows that the arguments that anti-piracy advocates use to convince consumers not to engage in this behaviour may not be as effective as some would think.','- Attempts at limiting the expansion of music piracy in the future should foremost target younger consumers.\n\n- Strategies of making pirates aware of the negative consequences of their actions, or letting them know that their actions hurt the artists and the music industry, or stimulating their deep moral values, is going to change the situation will most likely have no impact on the mechanics through which attitudes toward and intentions to engage in music piracy unfold.\n\n- The most important may be the inconsistency of the entire spectrum of messages that are sent to consumers.',NULL,'http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10603-005-8489-5',0,0,0,'A dataset of 139 business students from a large Canadian business school.'),('Danahar,_Smith_and_Teland_(2015)','Danahar, Smith and Teland  (2015)','http://www.copyrightevidence.org/evidence-wiki/index.php/Danahar,_Smith_and_Teland_(2015)',2015,'\'Copyright Enforcement in the Digital Age: Emprical Evidence and Conclusions’','The digitization of media goods weakened the effective strength of copyright policy by allowing widespread sharing of media files over the Internet, forcing governments to consider how to reform copyright policy to reflect the digital era and forcing firms to consider new strategies in order to compete with online piracy.

We address these two questions using the removal of NBC content from Apple’s iTunes store in December 2007, and its restoration in September 2008, as natural shocks to the supply of legitimate digital content, and analyzing its impact on demand through BitTorrent piracy channels and the Amazon.com DVD store. \n\nTo do this we collect two large datasets from Mininova and Amazon.com documenting levels of piracy and DVD sales for both NBC and other major networks’ content around these events. We analyze this data in a difference-in-difference model and find that NBC’s decision to remove its content from iTunes in December 2007 is causally associated with an 11.2% increase in the demand for pirated content. This is roughly equivalent to an increase of 49,000 downloads a day for NBC\'s content and is approximately twice as large as the total legal purchases on iTunes for the same content in the period preceding the removal. We also find evidence of a smaller, and statistically insignificant, decrease in piracy for the same content when it was restored to the iTunes store in September 2008. Finally, we see no change in demand for NBC’s DVD content at Amazon.com associated with NBC’s closing or reopening of their digital distribution channel on iTunes.','The results of this study are:\n\n* NBC’s decision to remove its content from the iTunes music store on December 1, 2007 caused an 11.2% increase in piracy of that content over and above any change experienced by competitor networks ABC, CBS, and Fox over the same period.\n\n* This large jump in piracy (larger than the size of the iTunes market) is predicted by theory when there is a significant fixed cost to piracy but only a small (or no) variable cost. In other words, iTunes purchasers may avoid piracy because the fixed cost to learn to use BitTorrent (or the fixed moral/stigma cost of illegal behavior) makes piracy less attractive than iTunes.\n\n* When the digital sales channel is not available, these individuals turn to piracy, pay the fixed cost and, owing to the seemingly low marginal costs of additional downloads, begin to consume much more content through piracy than they had previously purchased.  \n\n* When NBC removed their archived seasons of television from iTunes, we found no significant change in the Amazon.com sales rank for NBC’s DVD sales relative to the trend that we saw for non-NBC box sets. One possible interpretation of this finding is that digital downloads and DVD’s are simply not substitutes in the short term.  \n\n*Adding a digital distribution channel would not lead to a short-term displacement in DVD box set sales.

Still, while there have been many academic studies showing that piracy hurts sales, there have been far fewer studies analyzing the effectiveness of anti-piracy measures in reversing this effect. This study attempts to address this question by analyzing how the HADOPI “three strikes” law in France affected digital music sales on the iTunes music store. To do this, we obtained a panel of iTunes sales data from the four major music labels (Universal\nMusic, Warner Music, EMI Music and Sony Music) across a broad set of countries. We then applied a difference-in-difference approach, using sales trends in a control group of European countries to simulate the counterfactual of what music sales in France would have been if HADOPI had not been passed. Our results suggest that increased consumer awareness of HADOPI caused iTunes song and album sales to increase by 22.5% and 25% respectively relative to changes in the control group. In terms of robustness, we find that these sales changes are similar for each of the four major music labels, suggesting that our results are not peculiar to any particular label. We also find that the observed sales increase is much larger in genres that, prior to HADOPI, experienced high piracy levels (e.g., Rap and Hip Hop) than for less pirated genres (e.g., Christian music, classical, and jazz). This strengthens the causal interpretation of our results since if HADOPI is causing pirates to become legitimate purchases, its effects should be stronger for heavily pirated music than it is for other music genres.','The mains results of this study are:\n\n* The authors state that the results suggest that the HADOPI law (and the education and media attention surrounding it) increased iTunes single sales by 90,000 units per week on average. Assuming an average song price of €1 per song, this equates to an increase of €4.7 million ($6.3 million) in annual iTunes track revenues.\n\n* Results suggest that HADOPI causally increased French digital albums sales by an average of 11,200 units per week. Assuming an average of €8.5 per album, this equates to an increase of €4.9 million ($6.7 million) in annual iTunes album sales due to HADOPI.\n\n* Together, our estimates suggest that HADOPI increased annual iTunes revenues (tracks plus albums) by about €9.6 million ($13 million) per year for the four majors combined.\n\n* Under the assumption that the four majors make up 70% of the industry, if sales for the remaining 30% of artists experienced the same change in sales as we observe for the major labels, then the impact of HADOPI was to increase overall digital iTunes sales by €13.8 million ($18.6 million) per year for the entire music industry.\n\n* The effect of HADOPI was larger for more heavily pirated genres like Rap and smaller for less pirated genres like Christian music or Jazz, which is what one would expect if the increase in sales were causally related to HADOPI.\n\n* Increased consumer awareness of HADOPI caused iTunes song and album sales to increase by 22.5% and 25% respectively relative to changes in the control group.\n\n* The study occurs before anyone received a third notice (i.e. before any cases have been referred to the criminal court), and the increase in sales is observed even before the law’s final passage. While this may seem irrational, it is consistent with the idea that increasing the salience of the law, the illegality of piracy, and the potential penalties is sufficient to change user behavior.','\"For policy-makers, our results may have important implications in other countries that are considering passing similar graduated response laws, as well as in France where a number of parties oppose the continued existence of the law. Likewise, our results may inform industry practice in some countries, like the United States, that have seen the voluntary agreement between the music industry and Internet Service Providers on the application of a graduated response system.\"\n\n\"Additionally, other industries may benefit from HADOPI. For example, to the degree that the motion picture and publishing industries suffer losses caused by filesharing, HADOPI may positively impact revenues in those industries.

With the growth in movie piracy since the appearance of BitTorrent in 2003, films have become available through illegal piracy immediately after release in the US, while they are not available for legal viewing abroad until their foreign premieres in each country. We make use of this variation in international release lags to ask whether longer lags – which facilitate more local pre-release piracy – depress theatrical box office receipts, particularly after the widespread adoption of BitTorrent. We find that longer release windows are associated with decreased box office returns, even after controlling for film and country fixed effects. This relationship is much stronger in contexts where piracy is more prevalent: after BitTorrent’s adoption and in heavily-pirated genres. Our findings indicate that, as a lower bound, international box office returns in our sample were at least 7% lower than they would have been in the absence of pre-release piracy. By contrast, we do not see evidence of elevated sales displacement in US box office revenue following the adoption of BitTorrent, and we suggest that delayed legal availability of the content abroad may drive the losses to piracy.','* The longer the lag between the US release and the local foreign release, the lower the local foreign box office receipts. \n* This relationship is larger after the widespread adoption of BitTorrent than before: a movie release 8 weeks after the US premiere has lower returns by about 22% in a given country in 2003-2004. This increased to nearly 40% in 2005-2006.\n* From 2003-2004, the relationship between length of release lag and box office concerns was generally consistent across all film genres. From 2005-2006, each week of lag decreases returns for science fiction and action genres by an additional 1.3% per week over any decrease for other genres. \n* The writers estimate that international box office returns in the sample were at least 7% lower than they would have been in the absence of such piracy. This was determined by using the 1.3% reduction per week as the estimate of effect of pre-release piracy on box office sales. \n* The finding that the cost of delaying a film\'s foreign release is increasing has a strategic implication for the movie industry. Studios already appear to be reacting to this by shrinking the average release window. Studios should continue to reduce the length of the release lag, especially for genres more heavily pirated like science fiction and action films.','* Findings are potentially important to policymakers choosing policies to combat piracy, as policymakers need to know whether piracy is depressing sales. Results from this study suggest that piracy depresses the international box office.\n* Several countries have recently implemented strong legal policies against Internet piracy, such as the graduated response laws in France (HADOPI) and South Korea.

Controlling for the taste for music, various socio-demographic characteristics, as well as for the usual determinants of music consumption either offline (radio, TV, friends/relatives) or online (online recommendations, social networks), our results show that consuming music as streams (where the consumer does not possess the music but has just an access to it) has no significant effect on CDs purchase but is a complement to buying music online. The use of streaming services also affects positively live music attendance, but only for national or international artists who are more likely to be available on streaming services. These results suggest that a new music ecosystem is emerging in which the “possession” as well as the “access” modes of recorded music consumption might coexist.','* The regressions show that STREAMING has no impact on CD sales. Furthermore, streaming does have a positive impact on live music attendance, as expected, but only on concerts by national or international stars. Hence, unlike file-sharing, streaming turns out to have no impact on physical recorded music sales but like file-sharing, streaming is complementary with attending concerts by national or international stars. The recursive model enables the authors to bring to light the indirect effect of explanatory variables on the attendance of concerts by international and national stars. For instance, the taste for music and the recommendation of friends exhibit both direct and indirect effects on concert attendance. Being young, an intensive Internet user and using the web to get information and advice on music all favour the practice of streaming and indirectly play a role in concert attendance. Conversely, being male and earning a large income only affect the INTER variable.\n\n* Results concerning socio-economic variables are as expected. Individuals between 40 and 59 years-old buy more CDs. Age is also a strong determinant of attendance of classical concerts. Income and education are positively correlated with music consumption. Internet users in large cities have a higher probability of going to concerts of classical music or by local artists, which can be explained by the availability of these concerts in bigger cities. More surprising is the negative relationship between the local population size and the consumption of CDs in conventional offline retailers. One explanation might be that since access to live music is more difficult in less densely populated areas, the best way to obtain access to music content is to buy physical goods. It is also noted that the variable controlling for regional specificity also seems to capture a singularity for respondents from Brittany.\n\n* The results support two major findings concerning the impact of streaming on music consumption. First, streaming has no effect on offline music sales. Second, streaming has a positive effect on attendance of concerts by national and international stars but not on concerts of classical music or by local artists.','* Streaming platforms can help to provide new business models for artists and the music industry, in line with recent literature on the impact of digital piracy on ancillary markets and on the rise of a new contractual organization in the recorded music industry.\n\n* The fact that streaming has no negative effect on recorded music but a positive effect on attendance of concerts by national or international artists represents an important difference from file-sharing. It suggests that streaming is an online medium that promotes music (like TV or radio broadcasting) and that reinforces rather than harms the music industry.

In this manner, the real significance of Areopagitica in the history of copyright law lies in the way in which the work was misinterpreted and re-branded as an essay expounding the author\'s natural proprietary rights.\n\n*The use of Milton and his work to substantiate claims about the natural proprietary rights of the author, while carrying considerable rhetorical weight, may not accurately reflect Milton\'s attitudes and thoughts upon the same. \n\n*To draw upon Milton to warn against the dangers of allowing any individual to determine, on the grounds of their religious or political conviction, whether another\'s work should be published or not, is arguably a more fitting and appropriate use of the poet\'s opinions and his work.','Since the early eighteenth century Milton\'s contract with Simmons has been co-opted, in a variety of ways, to service contemporary debates about the status of the author, about author-publisher relations, and about the nature of the relationship between an author and his work within the context of the emerging copyright regime.

By documenting changes in discourse occurring between 1998 and 2004 over the labeling of music file-sharing as deviant, it seeks to unveil how power machinates in establishing the parameters between acceptable and unacceptable behaviors. In doing so, Foucault\'s work on power is used as a starting point for investigating strategies employed by corporate elites and file-sharers in order to shift the balance of power. The contest between discourses seeking to restrict or enhance the capacities of free agents in online environments is evidenced in the mutability of a legal discourse seeking to normalize online life. Until now, how the online “music pirates” should be disciplined is in a state of flux where certain developments appear to be favoring corporate interests and others, the interests of music file-sharers. In this struggle, online discourses seeking to curtail freedoms and opportunities advanced by corporate elites and online discourses of freedom purported by music file-sharers, are reversible. This reversibility suggests that online, some offline discourses would be a hindrance and as such, their agents could resist the dominant online discourse by engaging in creative behaviors. Likewise, traversing offline producer-led discourses with innovative and creative actions online could lead to consumers\' autonomy. This paper concludes that the significance of these online struggles is embedded not only in their outcomes but also in the processes leading to them. Thus, while attempts to curb these online practices and freedoms persist, changes to a discourse guiding trading conditions between the Recording Industry and end-users have been noted, constituting a victory for the latter.','This article utilizes Michel Foucault’s work in order to account for the changing power relations that exist between corporate elites and online music file-sharers, by analyzing changes in discourses and practices surrounding the free exchange of music through peer-to-peer file-sharing systems. \"In seeking to define and discipline emerging behavior, confrontations between discourses, some in support of the copyright holder, others aiming to defend rights of privacy, free expression and fair use, have created a mutable discursive form. In flux, these attempts to discipline online behavior also highlight the reversibility in roles played by those upholding the \'everything goes\' ethos of the Net and those seeking to impose offline norms. Corporate agents, in their strategies to limit existing behaviors, resist online discourses of freedom, likewise, consumers committed to changing trading conditions engage in creative and innovative actions to traverse the field of actions established by an offline discourse. Revolutionaries, oppressors, pirates or victims, both producers and consumers depend on each other.

In a series of high profile decisions, content industries persuaded courts to accept expansive interpretations of contributory enforcement, to create novel doctrines of copyright infringement, and to apply broad interpretations of statutory damage provisions. Many private file-sharers, technology companies, university administrators and Internet service providers have felt the reach of this litigation effort. Yet a significant empirical anomaly exists: even as the copyright industry has ramped up the level of deterrence, online copyright infringements continue unabated.\n\nWhy has the legal battle against file-sharers been so ineffective? The most straightforward explanation is that infringers are not deterred, either because the probability of getting caught remains remote or because the sanctions are not sufficiently salient. If that is the case, the expansive statutory damage award remedies in recent decisions such as Capitol Records v. Thomas-Rasset and Sony BMG v. Tenebaum, carry renewed promise for the entertainment industry. \n\nIn this Article we claim that this deterrence-based approach will prove futile and even counterproductive to the goals of copyright holders. We argue that copyright law faces conditions similar to Prohibition and other historical episodes of enforcement failure. When infringements are widespread, effective deterrence cannot be attained without raising enforcement to levels that undermine the support for the underlying rules. As a result, enforcement has the inadvertent effect of moving behavior in the opposite direction from that intended by the law. In the context of copyright law, enforcement has increased the gap between the social and legal perceptions of copyright law. Because file sharers, as a group, perceive copyright litigation as excessive, this inadvertently strengthens opposition to the legally protected interests of copyright law. \n\nTo further our understanding of the interplay between enforcement and public attitudes, we conduct two empirical studies on norms and copyright law. The results confirm that copyright enforcement is a double-edged sword. While stringent sanctions have a modest deterrent effect on file-sharing behavior, they increase anti-copyright sentiments among frequent offenders. This raises a spectacular challenge for copyright enforcement-the more copyright owners push to step up sanctions for copyright infringements; the more the public resents the protected rights. Consequently, stepping up sanctions tends to increase - rather than decrease - the rate and frequency of infringing activities. Our key results suggest therefore, that more stringent copyright enforcement will further erode respect for copyrights and may prove counterproductive to copyright owners.','This study found that severe and heightened enforcement of copyright law amongst students who illegally download music from file-sharing sites resulted in anti-copyright resentment, with a positive correlation between degree of backlash and amount of downloading prior to data collection; this suggests a tipping point for amount of downloads to influence a normative shift.  Students receiving severe sanctions reported plans to download more in the future as compared to students receiving moderate sanctions, creating a copyright backlash.','Sanctions can deter or encourage file-sharing behaviour, and different types of sanctions should be implemented for different types of infringers so as to avoid counterproductive backlash.  In order to influence embedded norms about copyright, music companies must do more to foster desired social behaviours through outreach and marketing campaigns; however, social norms are difficult to manipulate and alternate norm systems are already developing.','http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=740184','http://lawreview.usc.edu/index.php/articles-copyright-backlash/',0,0,0,'404 students (252 female and 152 males, ages 18 to 24) completed one of two surveys: \n# participants were asked to evaluate how different enforcement situations would influence their own downloading behaviour; and \n# different participants were split into two randomly assigned groups with proposed scenarios, one with high certainty but low severity of punishment and a second with converse conditions.  \n\nParticipants were students of undergraduate political science courses (unaware the survey would be offered in class that day) and included only students who indicated they had illegally downloaded previously.'),('Depoorter-Vanneste_(2005)','Norms and Enforcement: The Case against Copyright Litigation','http://www.copyrightevidence.org/evidence-wiki/index.php/Depoorter-Vanneste_(2005)',2005,'Norms and Enforcement: The Case against Copyright Litigation','In the past few years, we have witnessed a historical shift in the\nenforcement of copyright law. While copyright enforcement\nagainst private copying traditionally centered on commercial intermediaries\nand piracy, content owners now also pursue infringement\nactions against consumers and private copiers\ndirectly. While consumers of pirated content have traditionally\nbeen captured indirectly through taxes or blanket licenses, they\nare now subjected to a mass litigation campaign.\nDespite the wide media attention and spectacular headlines,\nlitigation has produced only limited results in the present era of\ndigital downloading and peer-to-peer (or \"P2P\") file swapping.\nLawsuits against private copiers have not halted file-sharing activities.\nAn ever-increasing number of unlicensed downloads are\ntaking place in private homes all over the world. According to\nrecent data, over twelve million people\' are simultaneously sharing\n1.08 billion music, movie, and software files on the Internet at\nany given moment.\nWhy are individuals unresponsive to the increased costs ofdownloading unlicensed music? One possible reason is that individuals\nsimply believe that the chances of being caught are too\nremote because there are so many people downloading at any\ngiven moment in time. Downloading fell temporarily during the\ninitial wave of lawsuits but increased again during subsequent\nrounds of lawsuits as file swappers updated their estimation of\nthe chances of getting caught.3\nNotwithstanding the limited deterrent effect of lawsuits on file\nsharing, record industry representatives, who often refer to lawsuits\nin terms of \"educating\" the public on copyright law,4 have\nannounced that they will continue to pursue litigation against individual\nfile swappers. In this Article, we suggest that if litigation\nindeed serves purposes other than deterrence, legal sanctions are\nunlikely to alter the social meaning and legitimacy of peer-topeer\nnetworks and file sharing. Because of a convinced belief\namong copyright users that file sharing should be legal, copyright\nenforcement is challenged by a social norm complication. Drawing\non socio-psychological literature and new data from an empirical\nstudy, we posit that copyright litigation faces an\nimpossibility theorem: lawsuits against file sharers cannot simultaneously\nachieve effective deterrence and promote procopyright\nnorms.\nPart I provides an overview of recent copyright litigation\nagainst copyright infringers on file-sharing networks. In Part 2, we apply the rational choice paradigm to litigation of private\ncopying and complement it with norm-based approaches.\nPart III examines behavioral adjustments and social norms effects\nin a scenario study where students are subjected to varying\nmodalities of copyright law enforcement. The aim of the study is\nto investigate the effect of copyright law enforcement on anticopyright\nnorms among file swappers on peer-to-peer networks\nand to examine differences between experienced users of filesharing\ntechnologies and individuals who have not (yet) engaged\nin file sharing.\nThe evidence from our study raises the hypothesis that deterrence\nand norms work at cross-purposes. Experienced users of\npeer-to-peer technology have internalized an anticopyright norm\nthat cannot be unraveled through enforcement. Anticopyright\nnorms of file swapppers are strengthened when the level of copyright\nenforcement increases, which results in more downloading\nwhenever enforcement is temporarily suspended. Enforcement has an ambivalent effect on individuals who have no experience\nwith file sharing. Severe sanctions do not have a counterproductive\neffect on copyright norms of such \"non-file sharers,\" yet exposure\nto information on copyright enforcement against peer-topeer\nsoftware reinforces the belief or expectation that others are\ndownloading.\nPart IV reflects on the lessons learned from the study, in particular\nwith regard to the policy choices that regulators, courts,\nand copyright-dependent industries face when approaching the\nwidespread use of copyrighted material on file-sharing networks.\nThese options, including criminal prosecutions of digital piracy,\ncopyright education, self-help strategies, and collective licensing,\nare evaluated in light of the interaction of deterrence and anticopyright\nnorms. We will argue that social norm backlash is\nparticularly relevant for copyright law because circumvention\ntechnology and the so-called technological \"arms race\" between\ncontent holders and pirates inevitably create lapses in copyright\nenforcement. During these intervals of reduced enforcement,\nconduct is determined by norms.\nFinally, Part V considers the recent decision by the Supreme\nCourt in MGM Studios, Inc. v. Grokster, Ltd., which held that\nproducers of file-sharing applications can potentially be held ac-countable for distributing software. Because Grokster focuses\non the commercial intent of P2P producers, it is doubtful that the\ndecision will be an effective tool in reducing the availability of\nfile-sharing technology. As digital technology becomes more decentralized,\nit is increasingly judgment-proof. File-sharing applications\nare produced in user-driven innovation environments\nthat operate without centralized, residual claimants. Life cycles\nof software applications extend beyond the legal and financial\nstatus of their creators. This suggests that we have only seen the\ntip of the iceberg with regard to lawsuits against private copiers.\nWe use copyright enforcement as a case study for the interaction\nbetween law enforcement and norms in general. The literature\non social norms suggests that when legal sanctions violate\nthe subjective conception of behavior that is being punished, individuals\nrespond differently when that enforcement coincides\nwith preexisting notions of what is just or appropriate. Although\nsome studies have investigated the conflict of deterrence and\nnorms with regard to tax evasion, the dynamics of social norms\nand law enforcement remain poorly understood. This Article addresses\nseveral gaps in the existing literature. While there is an\nabundance of theoretical attention to social norms, there is little\nempirical data on the interaction between norms and law enforcement.\nAlso, this Article supplements the limited literature\non enforcement patterns in copyright law.',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,0,0,0,''),('Depoorter_and_Walker_(2013)','Depoorter and Walker (2013)','http://www.copyrightevidence.org/evidence-wiki/index.php/Depoorter_and_Walker_(2013)_2',2013,'Copyright False Positives','Copyright enforcement is riddled with false positives. A false positive occurs when enforcement actions are taken against uses that are not actual infringements. Far from benign occurrences, copyright false positives inflict significant social harm in the form of increased litigation and transaction costs, distortions of licensing markets through rent-seeking behavior, increased piracy due to diminished public adherence with copyright law, and the systemic erosion of free speech rights and the public domain.\n\nTo combat this problem, this Article analyzes the causes that give rise to false positives, as well as their legal and social effects, and offers policy recommendations targeted at mitigating the damage of false positives. These policy recommendations include heightening the registration requirements to include a substantive review of all copyright claims; the promulgation of regulations dictating that copyright registrations be periodically renewed; and revision to the statutory damage provisions of the Copyright Act in order to encourage litigation that would help to excise false positives from the copyright corpus.','Copyright false positives result in social harms that are often difficult to detect, but are nonetheless widespread and pernicious in their effects. The indeterminacy of clear boundaries between copyright claims—the result of minimal registration requirements and strong disincentives to litigation—allow for rent-seeking by opportunistic copyright owners and corresponding deadweight losses for licensees. As a result, information, transaction, and litigation costs for all participants in the copyright system are artificially increased. Moreover, attempts to push the lawful boundaries of copyright protection via overly broad, and sometimes ostensibly bogus,\nclaims results in a public backlash. This decreases respect for and adherence to copyright law, and sets off a vicious downward spiral of increased piracy and increasingly aggressive enforcement tactics. In the process, labor and capital investments in creative enterprises are waylaid for fears of liability. Finally, and most dangerously, constitutionally protected speech rights are imperiled by the deterioration of the “safety valves” (fair use and the idea/expression dichotomy) that protect the First Amendment from the overexpansion of intellectual property rights.','To combat the growing problem of copyright false positives this Article offers various policy recommendations targeted at reducing the number of false positives and mitigating the damage they cause: \n(A) heightening registration requirements to include a substantive review of all copyright claims to be registered (these heightened requirements would not affect the substantive scope of copyright protection, but rather would create a procedural safeguard to diminish the number of questionable copyright claims ending up in court; \n(B) promulgating regulations that require periodic renewal of copyright registration; and \n(C) revising the statutory damage provisions in order to incentivize more copyright defense, thereby reducing the number of uncontested false positives.','http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2337684','http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2337684',0,0,0,'This article uses data from 42 US Cases'),('Derclaye_(2014)','Derclaye (2014)','http://www.copyrightevidence.org/evidence-wiki/index.php/Derclaye_(2014)_2',2014,'Do patents, trademarks and designs foster happiness in developed countries?

The Motion Picture Association of America estimates that US studios lose more than $3 billion annually in box office revenue from piracy. They have launched a major effort to prevent these losses. Yet their efforts are hampered by the ex post, counterfactual, and indirect methods by which losses are usually estimated. This paper addresses these issues directly. We develop and estimate a statistical model of the effects of piracy on the box-office performance of a widely-released movie. The model discredits the argument that piracy increases sales, showing unambiguously that Internet piracy diminished the box-office revenues of a widely released motion picture. The model overcomes a major weakness of counterfactual or “but for piracy” methods widely used to estimate damages. These counterfactual methods violate the “nobody knows” principle because they forecast what the movie would have earned in the absence piracy. The model we present does not violate this basic principle of motion picture uncertainty. We estimate that pre-release and contemporaneous Internet downloads of a major studio movie accelerated its box-office revenue decline and caused the picture to lose about $40 million in revenue.','This paper develops a model of piracy and revenue dynamics that permits early detection of piracy, directly tests the competing hypotheses regarding the effect of piracy on box office revenue dynamics, and does not violate the “nobody knows” principle.

Section 77 of the Copyright Act empowers the Copyright Board of Canada to issue a non-exclusive licence to an applicant whose reasonable efforts to locate a copyright owner have been unsuccessful. The article begins with a legal analysis of this statutory scheme, based on a review of every application made to the Board pursuant to s 77. These applications were catalogued into a database to facilitate detailed, empirical review and statistical analysis.

Only 5 applications were formally rejected. 22.2% of applications were abandoned because the copyright owner was found, usually with the help of the Board, and often with the help of collective societies. \n\nTiming:\n* It was difficult to generalize findings on application processing times because substantive methodological hurdles could not be factored into the analysis, nor did all files proceed in the same fashion. Even so, about half (49%) of the cases took less than 8 weeks to decide; one-fifth took between 2 and 4 months; 4 decisions (2%) took more than a year. 12% of decisions were issued within 2 weeks of the application being received and just over 25% took less than 1 month. \n* There was almost no difference in the processing time required to handle applications to use artistic, literary or musical works. By contrast, applications to use architectural works were completed in about a quarter of the time.\n* The Board processed applications for non-commercial uses of works more quickly than it processed applications for commercial uses.

TDM is, according to some, a growing and very promising economic sector. Its applications seem to be full of potentialities, in a whole range of sectors, from forensic investigation, to predictive marketing and scientific research in all kinds of sectors (be they commercial or not). At the same time, in today’s world, most information becomes available in a digital format, either from its first creation or because of the growing digitization of existing print archives.\nResearch is more and more relying on data analysis techniques and, as the quantity of information grows, so does the need to be able to rely on data analysis, because computers and software will more and more have to be called upon to analyze quantities of materials which human beings will, for time and resources reasons, no more have the possibility to read and screen. Data analysis also offers the possibility to uncover new relationships between information and data which science had always been unaware of.\nFrom a legal point of view, data analysis raises various issues, one of the important one being probably privacy and personal data protection. This Study however concentrates only on intellectual property, and particularly copyright and database protection (sui generis right).\nA few countries in the world have adopted or are in the process of adopting specific copyright provisions to introduce a data analysis exception in their legislation. The purpose of this Study was to describe how data analysis fits within the present legal context in Europe (both in terms of copyright and of database protection), to highlight the issues which may constitute obstacles or difficulties when applying the existing legal texts, and to analyze whether a new exception for data analysis would be useful or necessary. The purpose was not to suggest ready-to-use provisions for a new possible directive but only to give directions and make suggestions.','On the basis of our analysis, our suggestion is to have a new specific data analysis exception which would be inspired from, and contain partly the same conditions than, the scientific research exceptions, but which would have its own peculiarities. The suggestions are made only for TDM, not for scientific research in general.\nThe main reasons which, in our view, justify that a specific TDM exception be added to the existing legal framework have been explained in the Study and, in summary, are the following:\n- the present situation regarding the research scientific exceptions in the InfoSoc Directive and in Database Directive is not harmonized;\n- the exceptions for scientific research can be waived by contract;\n- there is a controversy as to whether the exceptions apply to “illustrate scientific research” or “for scientific research as such”;\n- the copyright exceptions in the InfoSoc Directive are limited “solely for scientific research”, which may be seen as excluding projects where, in addition to a scientific research objective, there may be other ancillary objectives;\n- the two directives impose mentioning the authors’ names and/or the sources, which may not always make sense for data analysis.\n\nThe main characteristics and contents of this new exception would be:\n- the exception would only apply where the purpose is mainly (and not “solely”) scientific research;\n- it would not just serve “to illustrate scientific research” but would apply more broadly in cases of “scientific research”;\n- it would only apply where justified by non-commercial purposes;\n- mentioning the sources or the names of the authors of the preexisting materials would not be an obligation but be left to the discretion of the researcher(s);\n- it would be an exception to the reproduction right (InfoSoc Directive and Database Directive), the adaptation right (both under the Database Direction and as part of the reproduction right in the InfoSoc Directive) and the extraction right (Database Directive);\n- it would not apply to tools designed for data analysis (which should remain untouched by the exception);\n- it would not apply if the data analysis output substitutes for the pre-existing works or databases and makes the consultation of these pre-existing elements useless;\nStudy of the legal framework of text and data mining (TDM) 117\n- it would only benefit users having a lawful access to the data;\n- it could not be overridden by contractual terms;\n- it would not be optional for Member States but would be mandatory, so as to ensure a level playing field throughout the European Union.','The study explains that an exception covering data analysis would be welcome, inspired from, and contain partly the same conditions than, the scientific research exceptions, but which would have its own characteristics.

The Study identified the existence of different acts of reproduction – upstream and downstream – in the process of the act of making available, that may complicate the licensing of works for online use and have an impact in terms of conflicts of laws in case of infringement. However, the Study observed that the InfoSoc Directive does not regulate the relation between the making available right and the reproduction right. Both rights are autonomous and can apply cumulatively, so that a single technical act may simultaneously fall under the making available and the right of reproduction, even if those rights are managed separately. In a second part, the Study analyzed two criteria that could help localizing the making available right (country of origin principle and place of the exploitation of the work) and assessed which consequences they would have on the selected topics. It showed that these localization criteria would not solve the bottlenecks found under the current state of law with regard to the reproduction right, as both the uploader and the end user having access to a work made available online would still face issues regarding the copies made in the course of the technological process used.\n\nThe present Study deepens the analysis of the relation between the making available right and the reproduction right. Considering acts of streaming and downloading, it examines whether the copies of works made through the technical process of making them available on the internet fall under the scope of art. 2 of the InfoSoc Directive, and whether these may be exempted under the exception for temporary copy or the exception for private copy provided by art. 5.','Firstly, we have examined whether the definition of the exclusive rights and the qualification of online exploitations could provide a solution.\n\nSecondly, there could be an obligation upon the author or initial right holder to transfer only coherent bundles of rights to the effect that the licensee acquires all rights it needs for a particular form of exploitation of a work or other subject matter. This obligation could be extended to subsequent transfers of rights by derived right holders.\n\nThirdly, the right holders’ ability to license their rights could otherwise be limited in order to facilitate the exploitation of works and other subject matter in several Member States. One option is to impose compulsory licences for the first download following the public availability of the work or other subject matter.\n\nFinally, the territorial effects of the reproduction right can be attenuated to a certain extent by the modification of the exceptions.  On the one hand, the exception for temporary acts of reproduction could be extended to emphasise the incidental character of the reproduction and its lack of independent economic significance vis-à-vis the making available to the public of the work or other subject matter. On the other hand, the exception for “private copies” could exempt certain downloads of works made available to the public.','The Study examined various legal constructions to deal with the different territorial impact of the making available right and the reproduction right and, more in particular, to localise the\nreproductions following directly from the public availability of a work or other subject matter according to the localisation criteria proposed in the previous Study.\nHowever, one construction does not all issues. More empirical (economic) data are required before a legislative initiative is taken in this domain and that it should be verified whether an approach per exploitation sector is more appropriate than a general and unique regime applicable to all types of works and all exploitation modes.','http://ec.europa.eu/internal_market/copyright/docs/studies/141219-study_en.pdf','http://ec.europa.eu/internal_market/copyright/docs/studies/141219-study_en.pdf',1,0,1,'International comparison and interpretation of statutes and legal definitions.'),('Dickson_(2010)','Dickson (2010)','http://www.copyrightevidence.org/evidence-wiki/index.php/Dickson_(2010)',2010,'Due diligence, futile effort: Copyright and the digitization of the Thomas E.

Copyright owners and technology firms negotiate over new ways of distributing and transmitting creative works. Understanding the shadow that copyright casts on private negotiations will allow policy makers to better design the statute in a way that encourages more competition, diversity, and transactional efficiency in markets for digital goods. Prime examples of copyright licensing negotiations are the attempts to license digital music services over the past decade. In this Article we present the first qualitative and quantitative data about the licensing process for on-demand music streaming services, gleaned from confidential interviews with executives and attorneys. We report our findings about the time it takes to license a nascent service, if negotiations succeed; the number of record labels and publishers with which new music services typically deal; the general processes through which these licenses evolve; and how changes in the law over the period may have affected the dynamics of these negotiations. We find that copyright law, alongside business practices and professional attitudes, sets complex background rules for these private licensing negotiations. Copyright shapes, constrains, and also presents opportunities for innovation.','* For those interactive music services that have obtained direct licenses from music owners it has taken as little as nine months and in excess of twenty-four months to obtain those licenses. At the median, licensing activities have required about eighteen months of effort. The majority of this time period, roughly  five-­‐sixths, is spent in discussions with major rights holders, those “major labels” that are also major publishers. The remaining proportion, about one-­‐sixth of the period, is spent negotiating with major rights collectives and other aggregators\n\n* There was a slight decrease of approximately three months over the last decade in terms of the time it has taken to obtain licenses from the set of sound recording owners considered crucial for launch. \n\n*  The number of sound recordings with which services launch has increased dramatically over the last decade. Pressplay and MusicNet, both of which first offered their services in December 2001, each launched with approximately 100,000 tracks—just a portion of the recordings contained in the catalogs of the then five major labels. In contrast, Rdio launched its service in 2010 claiming greater than seven million tracks available. The most significant factor that increased the number of tracks available was the emergence of large aggregators of independent rights.\n\n* It is possible to see a significant decrease over the last decade in the amount of time it has taken to obtain a sufficient collection of licenses covering the use of musical works for interactive services—as long as that use fits a discrete set of qualifications. What once was a prolonged operation requiring not months but years of ongoing negotiations can now, at least in large part, be accomplished in as short a timeframe as under ninety days. \n\n*  At least in the past, certain service offerings that were not licensed by the quorum of major labels and publishers were voluntarily licensed by other sets of rights owners.','* Because the copyright statute so heavily influences industries like the music industry, evaluating the state of private licensing negotiations amounts to evaluating the state of the copyright statute. To consider the merits of copyright reform in one direction or another, policy makers should be gathering all the empirical evidence they can. This Article has aimed to contribute to deliberations over copyright reform by describing the nature of the licensing negotiations for digital music services. Secrecy and private information render it infeasible to construct a large, quantitative data set consisting of both successful and failed attempts at licensing. Studies like ours, however, based on interviews with individuals directly involved in licensing negotiations, shed important light on the realities of the marketplace. \n\n* The direct licensing process can require a surprisingly similar amount of time (at the median) to the time it takes a rate-setting proceeding to reach its resolution. In both cases there are the extremes—when the rate-setting process drags for years, or the direct licensing process never succeeds. But we do need to understand whether and why these two very different paths to market—each determining service features, royalty rates, and consumer pricing in different ways—may actually require quite similar periods of time.\n\n* In future designs of the copyright statute, the goal should be efficient resolution of conflicts between copyright owners and firms with new distribution technologies. Congress must understand that unless they choose to make certain arrangements mandatory (i.e., unless Congress forbids contracting around the copyright statute in various ways) their statutory scheme is merely one constraint in a complex private negotiation. Copyright law, along with business practices and perceptions, determines each side’s bargaining position in private licensing negotiations. Congress, along with the other government institutions that make copyright policy, should aim to give both sides some leverage.','http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2625300','http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2625300',0,0,0,'The authors collected relevant data for more than twenty music services in total, resulting in a representative sample whose lifecycles spanned more than a decade of licensing efforts.

We find that paradoxically an industry coalition that had successfully lobbied during the TRIPS negotiations for a global copyright protection regime ran into trouble developing and enforcing it via technical standards in the market place, while a loose and emerging civil society coalition defending ‘fair use’ proved to be more effective to establish private copy-left licenses in the market than it had been before in influencing agenda setting in the political sphere.

We find that paradoxically an industry coalition that had successfully lobbied during the TRIPS negotiations for a global copyright protection regime ran into trouble developing and enforcing it via technical standards in the market place, while a loose and emerging civil society coalition defending ‘fair use’ proved to be more effective to establish private copy-left licenses in the market than it had been before in influencing agenda setting in the political sphere.

The Internet provides an opportunity to make archival material more widely accessible; however, repositories’ copyright practices in making their holdings available online may affect the extent to which wider access to archival material is actually achieved. The study employed four different sources of evidence, i.e., the website content of 154 Canadian repositories whose websites feature archival material from the repository’s holdings; copyright\npolicy and procedure documents of those repositories; 106 responses to a questionnaire sent to the staff of those repositories; and 22 interviews with repository staff members. In terms of selection for online access, the study found that the repositories studied prefer to select items that are perceived to incur little risk of copyright infringement (because the copyright has expired or because the repository owns the copyright), or items that require few or no resources to investigate copyright status or obtain copyright authorizations. Thus, with regard to selection, repositories were more restrictive than the law required, largely due to lack of resources.\nAlthough repositories have no legal or professional obligation to enforce others’ copyright interests, they nonetheless attempt to control further uses of their online holdings through the use of technical measures (e.g., low resolution images, watermarks, etc.) or non-technical measures (e.g., conditions placed on further uses), for reasons not necessarily related to copyright. Overall, the study found that repositories’ practices in making their holding available online were more restrictive than copyright law envisages. While this may be due to factors other than copyright, access to online documentary heritage may be limited as a result.','Making archival holdings available for research and encouraging their use are fundamental goals of professional archival practice. Canadian repositories have seized the Internet as a new opportunity for wider access to their holdings. From the perspective of copyright, they make selected holdings available on the Internet in an uncertain environment without expert advice, and without conducting exhaustive research to be sure of every expiry date or rights holder. However, 80% of the questionnaire respondents think copyright is a problem for archival repositories making their holdings available online. Consequently, they are more restrictive than copyright law requires, both in terms of what they select for online access and in terms of their attempts to control further uses of their holdings for reasons that are associated (rightly or wrongly) with copyright.','Copyright is widely perceived to be a problem when it comes to making cultural heritage available on the Internet, in that obtaining the necessary copyright clearances is often difficult and, according to digitization manuals, an item cannot be made available on the Internet without the appropriated permissions. The study examined a number of aspects of the copyright practices of Canadian archival repositories relating to making their holdings available on the Internet. There is some evidence that the “best” documents are not being selected for Internet access because repositories lack the resources needed to identify and obtain the necessary authorizations, or because repositories interpret copyright conservatively. In terms of further uses of online archival holdings, archival repositories, consistent with their onsite practices, want to control further uses of their online holdings in a “quasicopyright-like” way. However, there is also evidence that much of the perceived copyright “problem” lies in copyright law itself, because of its complexity and because repositories lack reliable up-to-date tools and resources to assist them in administering copyright. The findings have possible implications for archival practice and public policy which merit further investigation.','https://tspace.library.utoronto.ca/bitstream/1807/11198/1/Dryden_Jean_E_200806_PhD_thesis.pdf','https://tspace.library.utoronto.ca/bitstream/1807/11198/1/Dryden_Jean_E_200806_PhD_thesis.pdf',0,0,0,'The study uses data collected from 154 cultural repositories, from the websites and published policy documents of the repositories and also from responses to 106 questionnaires and 22 interviews with staff from those repositories.'),('Durham,_Hirshleifer,_Smith_(1998)','Durham, Hirshleifer, Smith (1998)','http://www.copyrightevidence.org/evidence-wiki/index.php/Durham,_Hirshleifer,_Smith_(1998)',1998,'Do the Rich Get Richer and the Poor Poorer? Experimental Tests of a Model of Power','In a market economy, there is no clear implication as to whether economic activities will tend to reduce or else to widen initial wealth disparities. When it comes to political or military struggles, in contrast, it might be expected that initially stronger or richer contenders would grow ever stronger and richer still. What has been termed the Paradox of Power (Hirshleifer, 1991) is the observation that very often the reverse occurs: poorer or weaker contestants improve their position relative to richer or stronger opponents. In warfare, small nations have often defeated larger ones, as notably occurred in Vietnam. Individuals, groups, or nations - if rational and self-interested - will equalize the marginal returns of two main ways of generating income: production and mutually advantageous exchange, versus appropriate efforts designed to redistribute income or capture resources previously controlled by other parties.','We tested two main kinds of predictions: ( 1 ) The first group dealt \'with issues common to much of the game-theoretic and experimental literature. Of these, the major question was the degree to which the experimental outcomes approximated the noncooperative Nash solution, as opposed to a more cooperative outcome generating a larger in- come for the group as a whole. We also compared protocols with randomly varying partners each round as opposed to fixed partners over the entire sequence of play. (2) The second group of predictions dealt with inferences from the specific model of conflict in Hirshleifer ( 1991 ), and specifically those associated with the Paradox of Power. The paradox is that, in many situations, an initially poorer side will end up gaining in relative position in comparison with an initially richer and thus stronger opponent. With regard to the first group of predictions, the experimental observations overwhelmingly supported the Nash as opposed to the Cooperative solution. However, while the Nash solution is much better supported in a dichotomous comparison between the two, the experimental results typically displayed some degree of slippage in the direction of cooperation. The convergence toward Nash was weaker under the fixed partners as opposed to the varying partners protocol, and also was weaker in the mature (sixteenth round) choices than the overall behavior. Together with an observed tendency toward positive correlation of the deviations from the Nash equilibrium, these results are consistent with a \"leaming to cooperate\" interpretation. Fixed partners over multiple rounds of interaction favor the development of mutual understanding relative to varying partners. Still, we must reemphasize, overall the results were dominated by noncooperative (Nash) behavior.','* Decision-makers (individual actors or firms) must make a decision between two classes of economic activities: production or conflict\n* Decision-makers tend towards either a co-operative or non-cooperative model \n* In the case of new technologies and business models this can effect change to the existing power structure, particularly if the Paradox of Power comes into play (where paradoxically the weaker side will overcome the stronger side)',NULL,'http://www.jstor.org/stable/117014',1,0,1,'24 experiments featuring 279 individual subjects'),('Dusollier_(2010)','Dusollier (2010)','http://www.copyrightevidence.org/evidence-wiki/index.php/Dusollier_(2010)',2010,'Scoping Study on Copyright and Related Rights and the Public Domain','Protection of the public domain comprises two steps, as laid down by the Development Agenda: first, identifying the contours of the public domain, thereby helping to assess its value and realm, and, second, considering and promoting the conservation and\naccessibility of the public domain.\n\nThe present study will follow the same direction as it will first assess the scope of the\npublic domain, as defined by copyright laws, history and philosophy, before turning to the\nissue of its effectiveness and greater availability to the public and society at large. This will lead to the formulation of some recommendations that, by viewing the public domain as material that should receive some positive status and protection, might help to support a robust public domain, as advocated by the Development Agenda.\n\nOur purpose is not to define what should be or not be in the public domain, nor to look\nat the causes of the shrinking of the public domain, or only incidentally. This study is\nsituated beyond the debate as to what should be copyrighted or not, to what extent and for how long. It will not deal with the question of determination of those limitations to intellectual property (as to the scope of the rights, the object of the protection, the adequate duration of the right, etc.). Such delineation is fundamentally a matter for policy that has to be decided by States, both at an international and national level.\nAs a consequence, the public domain that will be sketched here is not only what is left\nafter the contours of copyright have been drawn, but is a repository of resources of its own.\n\nAccordingly, the recommendations formulated at the end of this study will not focus on the\nscope of copyright and the way to curb it, but will rather try to develop strategies to make the public domain itself flourish and be made more available to the public. This study will also be limited to the public domain as resulting from copyright legal regimes and not by patent or trademark.\n\nPart I of this study will give an evaluation of the role of the public domain in copyright,\nstarting by a definition of what public domain is and what it should be distinguished from.\nThe public domain in the history and justification of copyright will also be provided.\nPart II will identify the components of the public domain, notably based on an\nillustrative comparison of national legislation. It will also analyse other legislatively granted rights and/or interests that may modify and interfere with the level of accessibility and usability of the copyright-related public domain. Part III will provide a survey of non-legislative and private ordering initiatives, which provide for greater access, use, identification and location of the public domain and other creative material whose conditions of use are akin thereto. Part IV will sketch a possible future for the public domain, by developing the impetus it is gaining in legislative and judicial contexts, the key principles that could govern it for a more positive status, and finally by formulating recommendations in regard to future activities on the public domain in relation to copyright that may be carried out by the World Intellectual Property Organization.','As far as identification of the public domain is concerned:\n\no The territoriality applying to the determination of the public domain should be further\nassessed. Recommendations are difficult to propose in that regard as substituting the\nlaw of the country of origin to the lex loci protectionis would only shift the uncertainty.\nInstead of having to deal with different laws when envisaging an exploitation of creative\nmaterial in different jurisdictions, the user will have to determine the status of the\nresources used according to the law of countries of origin, even for an exploitation\noccurring in a single country.\n\no The difficulty of the rule of the comparison of terms applicable to the duration for\nprotection, as provided by Article 7(8) of the Berne Convention, should at least be\nassessed.\no The voluntary relinquishment of copyright in works and dedication to the public domain\nshould be recognised as a legitimate exercise of authorship and copyright exclusivity, to the extent permitted by national laws (possibly excluding any abandonment of moral rights) and upon the condition of a formally expressed, informed and free consent of the author. Further research could certainly be carried out on that point.\n\no An exception or attenuation of the lex loci protectionis could be envisaged so as to\nmutually recognize the validity of a dedication to the public domain when valid in the\ncountry of origin of the work.\n\no The issue of orphan works should be dealt with at the international level or at least, a\nmutual recognition of the status of the orphan work applied in one country should be\nrecognized by other Parties to the Berne Convention (except when identification or location of the author can be solved in this other country). WIPO should also help to set up networks of information about works in order to facilitate the identification of authors of orphan works. This would clarify the protected or unprotected status of orphan works.\n\no International endeavours should be devoted to developing technical or informational\ntools to identify the contents of the public domain, particularly as far as the duration of\ncopyright is concerned. Such tools can be data collections on works, databases of public domain works, or public domain calculators. International cross-operation and cross-referencing of such tools is of particular importance.\n\no The 1996 WIPO Treaties could be modified to integrate, in the definition of “Rights\nManagement Information”, any electronic information pertaining to public domain works.\n\n- As far as the availability and sustainability of the public domain is concerned:\no The availability of the public domain should be enhanced, notably through cooperation\nwith cultural heritage institutions and UNESCO (through its work on the preservation of\nintangible cultural heritage).\n\no Legal deposit should be encouraged at national level, which might involve some\nfinancial and logistical help for developing countries. At international level, catalogues\nand cross-referencing of deposited works should be set up.\n\no The role of cultural heritage institutions, and mainly libraries, in the labelling,\ncataloguing, preserving and making available of public domain works, should be\nrecognised and supported, particularly in the digital environment.\n\no Research should be carried out to identify means to promote the divulgation and\nexploitation of public domain material in terms of funding and incentives. The research\ncould include the tool of the domaine public payant, as means to make commercial\nusers of public domain works contribute, through a minimal sum, to the collecting and\nmaintaining of public domain material carried out by public institutions. Where the moral\nright is perpetual, there should be ways of controlling possible abuses in exercising the\ndivulgation or integrity right.\n\no Any extension of the scope or duration of copyright and related rights, both at\ninternational and national level, should take into account the empirical effects on the\nsustainability of the public domain.\n\n- As far as the non-exclusivity and non-rivalry of the public domain is concerned:\no Legal means should be found to prevent the recapture of exclusivity in works that have\nfallen into the public domain, whether through another intellectual property right\n(trademark or right in databases), property rights, other legal entitlements or technical\nprotection, if such exclusivity is similar in scope or effect to that of copyright or is\ndetrimental to non-rivalrous or concurrent uses of the public domain work.\n\no The 1996 WIPO Treaties should be amended to prohibit a technical impediment to\nreproduce, publicly communicate or making available a work that has fallen into the\npublic domain. There is no legal basis for the enforcement of technical protection\nmeasures applied to the public domain, as public domain status should guarantee the\nright to make re-use, modification, reproduction and communication. It could also be\nclarified that only technological measures protecting copyrighted works that form a\nsubstantial part of the digital content to which they apply will be protected against\ncircumvention. Technological measures mainly protecting public domain works, with an\nancillary and minimal presence of copyrighted works, should not enjoy legal protection.\n\no As Berne countries are required to respect within their territory the intellectual property\nprotection granted by other countries, they should recognize the public domain status\ndefined by other countries and prevent privatization of what is in the public domain\nelsewhere.','The construction of a positive regime for the public domain, able to buttress the principles emphasized above would require both the adoption of normative rules in copyright laws and the setting up of material conditions to effectively enable access to, enjoyment and preservation of public domain resources. It is thus difficult to draw precise recommendations with a normative effect, as endeavours should be pervasive and might go beyond formal changes in intellectual\nproperty laws. Action might also be more appropriate at national level.

Faced with a threat to their form of capital accumulation from copyright infringement, rights holders have used discourse strategically in order to try and legitimate and strengthen their position in the digital copyright debate with governments and media users. In so doing, they have appealed to general justificatory principles – about what is good, right, and just – that provide some scope for opposition and critique, as other groups contest their interpretation of these principles and the evidence used to support them. In this article, we address the relative lack of academic attention paid to the role of discourse in copyright debates by analysing user-directed marketing campaigns and submissions to UK government policy consultations. We show how legitimacy claims are justified and critiqued, and conclude that amid these debates rests some hope of achieving a more legitimate policy resolution to the copyright wars – or at least the possibility of beginning a more constructive dialogue.','* Discourse can play a strategic role, alongside structural advantages, in promoting the interests of particular groups \n\n* Discourse should not be reduced entirely to economic interests and so dismissed as just so much more ideology in the Marxian sense. Rather, in legitimating economic arrangements actors appeal to general justificatory principles – about what is good, right and just – which involve a broader claim to public legitimacy. \n\n* Policy consultations do not always translate neatly into political outcomes and may be short circuited by other processes such as the direct lobbying of politicians\n\n* The rights holders’ strategic use of discourse reinforces the structural advantages they already tend to enjoy in the copyright debate. As a result, the copyright debate remains a far cry from a more deliberative process of copyright policy-making where a more legitimate détente to the copyright wars may be achieved.','* According to the authors, the legitimate resolution to the copyright wars or at least of beginning a more constructive dialogue will only become a reality through a more deliberative process of policy-making, where the discursive claims of actors are exchanged and debated more fully.\n\n* The authors stress the need to meaningfully involve members of the public themselves as a source of legitimate perspectives, not just as copyright infringers who need to be better educated or regulated: users are more than capable of offering rational justifications in relation to copyright, even in the absence of clear and detailed knowledge about it\n\n* The generic structures through which copyright policy is currently debated are limited because they do not require participants to engage directly with each other. In government consultations and even more so in industry campaigns, the stakeholders need not respond fully to counter arguments or account publicly for the apparent limitations and inconsistencies in the justificatory discourses they employ.','http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/pdf/10.1080/10286632.2013.874421','http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/10286632.2013.874421',0,0,0,'Alongside a literature review, the authors carry out an analysis of film, music and television industries marketing campaigns aimed at users and, through corporate and industry association websites, industry submissions to two major reviews of copyright commissioned by the UK government: The Gowers Review of Intellectual Property in 2006 and the Hargreaves Review of Digital Opportunity and Growth in 2011.'),('EIFL_(2013)','EIFL (2013)','http://www.copyrightevidence.org/evidence-wiki/index.php/EIFL_(2013)',2013,'The European Orphan Works Directive An EIFL Guide','This guide sets out the background and key provisions of the Directive 2012/28/EU.

For example: children’s storybooks that become oldfashioned; out-of-date political analysis of events; manuals for working people when the kind of work has changed, such as a handbook written in 1920 for domestic servants. \n  \n*Even where orphan works provide valuable resources for scholarship, the transaction costs involved in obtaining permission may be too high, or the risks of litigation too great for the library to undertake the task. Governments, legal scholars, librarians and rightholders recognize that it is not in the public interest for so many works to be locked away from public use.','*Member States should leave the list of sources as it stands in the Annex, without adding any further to the list. \n\n*Member States shall provide that a fair compensation is due to any re-appearing rightholder. The circumstances and level of compensation are to be decided by the law of the Member State in which the institution using the work is established. The non-commercial nature of the use, the public interest mission of the institution and the possible harm to rightholders will be taken into account in determining the amount (Recital 18). The Information Society Directive 2001/29/EC states that in situations where prejudice to the rightholder is likely to be minimal, no obligation for payment may arise (Recital 35). Compensation for the use of orphan works should follow the same principle, especially those that have not been in economic use for decades. In addition, a re-appearing rightholder must be able to demonstrate beyond doubt their right to the work, and the extent of their right (which may be shared with other rightholders who remain untraced). \n\n*Member States should follow the principle of the InfoSoc Directive and allow that a fair compensation may equal zero compensation in certain circumstances. \n\n* Member States should ensure in cases when a rightholder comes forward to claim their rights in a work that a proper system is in place for establishing the validity of their claim. \n\n*Unpublished works must be available for consultation in a Knowledge and Cultural Heritage Institution with the consent of the rightholder. An example would be the private diary of a life during wartime, written by a person whose son or daughter, having become the rightholder, gives it to a library after the death of the author, so that it can be consulted by researchers. This work will be an orphan work if the library cannot subsequently find the son or daughter, or cannot find the person who inherits their rights after they have died. The category “unpublished works” in the Directive therefore is very limited. Member States in addition can choose to exclude all unpublished works from the scope of the Directive if they are given to the library after 29 October 2014. Removal of another category of orphan work would have a negative impact on public access to historical and cultural materials, and it would add to the administrative burden of handling orphan works.  \n\n* Member States should not limit the application of Article 1.3 to works deposited with libraries before 29 October 2014.\n\n*Recognizing the growing problem of orphan works in the dissemination of Europe’s cultural heritage, the European Union decided to legislate to permit the use of orphan works in special circumstances.

In the United States, the transfer of infringing and non-pornographic content is estimated to be responsible for a minimum of 17.53% of all Internet bandwidth.\n\n* An in-depth analysis of the most popular 10,000 pieces of content (torrents) managed by PublicBT found: 63.7% of content managed by PublicBT was non-pornographic content that was copyrighted and shared illegitimately; 35.2% was film content – all of which was copyrighted and shared illegitimately; 14.5% was television content – all of which was copyrighted and shared illegitimately. Of this, 1.5% of content was Japanese anime and 0.3% was sports content; 6.7% was PC or console games -  all of which was copyrighted and shared illegitimately;2.9% was music content – all of which was copyrighted and shared illegitimately; 4.2% was software – all of which was copyrighted and shared illegitimately;0.2% was book (text or audio) or comic content – all of which was copyrighted and shared illegitimately; 35.8% was pornography, the largest single category. The copyright status of this was more difficult to discern but the majority is believed to be copyrighted and most likely shared illegitimately; 0.48% (just 48 files out of 10,000) could not be identified. Of all 10,000 files comprising the most popular content held on the PublicBT tracker, only one was identified as non-copyrighted (a file containing a list of IP addresses used to help users guard against spam and peer to peer monitoring). There is no evidence to support the idea that the transfer of non-copyrighted content such as Linux distributions makes up a significant amount of bittorrent traffic. Analysis strongly indicates that private bittorrent sites (which would not usually make use of PublicBT) are overwhelmingly used for the purposes of illegitimately sharing copyrighted data. \n\n*An examination of 2,000 random links pointing to content held on cyberlockers found that 91.5% of links pointing to non-pornographic material were linking to copyrighted material, or 73.15% of all links.   \n\n*A comparison of video streaming site usage estimated that 4.7% of video streaming data traffic is copyrighted content illegitimately streamed from video hosting sites.\n\n*Analysis of content posted to a number of Usenet newsgroups found that at least 93.4% of posts contained copyrighted material. \n\n* On the day of analysis, most upload and download activity was concentrated amongst a small number of those 2.7m torrents with 34.9% of all peers involved in the top 10,000 (just 0.37% of all torrents). There was an enormous long-tail of content which had only a few or no seeds or a few or no leechers. The chart shows the breakdown of all 2.72m swarms according to the number of downloaders (commonly called leechers) attached to each swarm12. Clearly, most of the swarms had only a small number of active downloaders or no active downloaders at all. 0.2% of torrents (6,468) had 100 or more downloaders; 2.6% of torrents (71,405) had from ten to 99 downloaders; 51.9% of torrents (1,413,606) had from one to nine downloaders; 45.2% of torrents (1,229,961) had no active downloads. A similar spread was evident for seeders (users holding a complete copy of the file). For almost half of all torrents (1.32m or 48.5%), no seed was connected.On the other hand, a very small overall proportion of content attracted large numbers of downloaders, representing a large proportion of all connected users.  As stated above, torrent swarms with 100 or more downloaders represented just 0.24% of the available 2.72m torrents, but more than one in three – 30.4% - of all peers connected to PublicBT.  Torrents with ten or more downloaders represented 2.6% of the 2.72mavailable torrents but over half – 53.9% - of all peers.','No policy implication stated','http://documents.envisional.com/docs/Envisional-Internet_Usage-Jan2011.pdf','http://documents.envisional.com/docs/Envisional-Internet_Usage-Jan2011.pdf',0,0,0,'An automated search, identification, and classification system for internet content was employed to crawl the internet to locate links to content stored on ten large cyberlockers like Rapidshare and MegaUpload.

It has never been so important to foster the “virtuous circle” leading from Research and Development (R&D) investment to jobs – via innovation, competitive advantage and economic success – as in today’s world of increasingly globalised markets and the knowledge\neconomy. This process depends on several different factors, but an efficient system of intellectual property rights (IPR) undoubtedly ranks among the most important, given IP’s capacity to encourage creativity and innovation, in all its various forms, throughout the economy.\nEurope already has a long tradition in this area: European countries have played a major part in\nshaping a modern and balanced system of IP rights which not only guarantees innovators their due\nreward but also stimulates a competitive market. It is nevertheless vital to ensure that the system remains a useful instrument in implementing new innovation policies designed to achieve those goals. At the same time, there have been several calls from industry for indicators to measure the economic impact of IP rights. Moreover, in view of the question marks which, in public debate, have sometimes been raised over IP’s role in supporting innovation and creativity, it is essential that facts and figures be produced to ensure such debate is based on sound evidence.\nThat is why the Office for Harmonization in the Internal Market (OHIM), acting through the European Observatory on Infringements of Intellectual Property Rights, and the European Patent Office (EPO) decided to join forces and carry out this study in co-operation with the European Commission, in particular DG Internal Market and Services and Eurostat.\nThere have already been several studies on specific IP rights, industrial sectors or countries, but the OHIM-EPO study is the first to quantify the overall contribution made by IPR‑intensive industries to the EU economy, in terms of output, employment, wages and trade, taking into account the major\nIP rights (patents, trade marks, designs, copyrights, geographical indications). Despite the\nconservative approach, reflected in the rigorous methodology applied, the main results are very\nimpressive: IPR-intensive industries generate more than a quarter of employment and more than a\nthird of economic activity in the EU.','IPR-intensive industries are defined as those having an above-average use of IPR per employee.\nThe present study shows that about half of European industries can be considered IPR‑intensive.\nIt should be emphasised, however, that all industries use IP rights to some extent. By focusing onlyon the IPR-intensive industries, this study arguably understates the real contribution of IP rights to the European economy.\nSuch IPR-intensive industries are shown to have generated almost 26% of all jobs in the EU during\nthe period 2008-2010, with almost 21% in trade mark-intensive industries, 12% in design-intensive\nindustries, 10% in patent-intensive industries, and smaller proportions in copyright-intensive and GI-intensive industries. On average over this period, 56.5 million Europeans were employed by\nIPR-intensive industries, out of a total employment of approximately 218 million. In addition, another 20 million jobs were generated in industries that supply goods and services to the IPR-intensive industries. Taking indirect jobs into account, the total number of IPR‑dependent jobs rises to just under 77 million (35.1%).\nOver the same period, IPR-intensive industries generated almost 39% of total economic activity\n(GDP) in the EU, worth € 4.7 trillion. They also accounted for most of the EU’s trade with the rest of the world, with design-intensive, copyright-intensive and GI-intensive industries generating a trade surplus.\nIPR-intensive industries also pay significantly higher wages than other industries, with a wage\npremium of more than 40%. This is consistent with the fact that the value added per worker is higher in IPR-intensive industries than elsewhere in the economy.','The study covers a broad range of IP rights – trade marks, patents, designs, copyright and\nGeographical Indications (GIs) – and considers a variety of economic indicators, in particular\nGross Domestic Product (GDP), employment, external trade and wages. It makes no policy\nrecommendations, as this is not within its scope. Instead, it is designed to provide evidence that can be used by policymakers in their work, and to serve as a basis for raising awareness of Intellectual Property among Europe’s citizens.\nThe study is intended to provide results that are comparable to those obtained for the US economy. The methodology used here is therefore closely related to that used in the pioneering study published in March 2012 by the Economics and Statistics Administration in the US Department of Commerce and the United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO).','https://euipo.europa.eu/tunnel-web/secure/webdav/guest/document_library/observatory/documents/IPContributionStudy/full_report/joint_report_epo_ohim.pdf','https://euipo.europa.eu/tunnel-web/secure/webdav/guest/document_library/observatory/documents/IPContributionStudy/full_report/joint_report_epo_ohim.pdf',1,0,1,'The study covers a broad range of IP rights – trade marks, patents, designs, copyright and Geographical Indications (GIs) – and considers a variety of economic indicators, in particular\nGross Domestic Product (GDP), employment, external trade and wages for 27 Member Sates (no data was available for recently-joined Croatia).'),('Erickson,_Heald,_Homberg,_Kretschmer_and_Mendis_(2015)','Erickson, Heald, Homberg, Kretschmer and Mendis (2015)','http://www.copyrightevidence.org/evidence-wiki/index.php/Erickson,_Heald,_Homberg,_Kretschmer_and_Mendis_(2015)',2015,'Copyright and the Value of the Public Domain: An Empirical Assessment','The purpose of this research study is 1) to map the size of the public domain and frequency of its use; 2) analyse the role of public domain works in value creation for UK businesses; 3) assist creators and entrepreneurs to identify business models that benefit from the public domain. In addition to these outputs, the intellectual contribution of this project was to arrive at a sufficiently precise definition of the public domain to permit measurement of its value, and secondly, to critically appraise theories of creativity and innovation that explain how value might be generated from non-exclusive use of ideas and works available to all. The non-rival, non-excludable nature of the public domain would seem to limit its appeal to creators in a competitive market. Any observed commercial uptake of public domain material consequently raises important questions: What stimulates creators to invest in transforming or re-publishing public domain works? How do firms gain and sustain competitive advantage when exploiting freely available public domain materials? Finally, what policy options are available to promote market uptake of public domain materials, and what are the likely impacts?','Researchers identified the following issues relating to public domain uptake in Study 1:\n\n*Creators working with visual or multimedia content reported difficulties in  locating and securing high-quality sources of public domain works (image resolution, digital format). This was a significant challenge to commercialisation.\n\n*Archives, museums, and libraries were frequently cited as useful partners when seeking access to public domain works, able to provide access to source material and data needed to ascertain copyright status of work.\n\n*There was little concern about competition due to non-excludability of source material, but firms worried about costs of marketing and sustaining PD projects when initial development cost and investment was also low.\n\n*Clarity on legal use (e.g. requirements for ‘diligent search’ when using orphan  works) would improve commercialisation potential.\n\nThe main findings for Study 2 were as follows:\n\n*Use of both public domain and third party licensed material were significantly associated with higher likelihood of project success.\n\n*Influence of public domain status on success rate was most pronounced in the mediums of Comics and Theatre, compared with Publishing and Video Games. This suggests that the role of PD materials differs across mediums. Direct re-publication of public domain literature does not seem to be rewarded – aptation to another medium may be more attractive to backers. \n\n*Explicitly obtaining copyright permission to use a third party work in a Kickstarter pitch was significantly associated with higher funding levels achieved.\n\n*Previous experience and status of pitch creator was also significant to project success, suggesting that familiarity of both underlying work and its creator is important to Kickstarter funders.\n\nStudy 3 found: \n\n*Public domain availability makes a significant difference to inclusion of images on Wikipedia. Biographies for notable authors born prior to 1880 have a greater likelihood of containing an image than those born more recently, even though camera  technology became widespread in the 20th Century. Less than 58% of authors in the sample born after 1880 have images associated with their Wikipedia pages.  \n\n*Controlling for notoriety of authors, composers and lyricists using a  matched-pairs technique, we found that pages with public domain images attracted between 17% and  19% more visitors than pages where no image was available, reflecting the value those images contribute to the Wikipedia resource.\n\n*Using commercially equivalent licence fees obtained from Corbis and Getty for images relating to the biographical sample, we estimate a total value of USD $208 million (GBP £138million) per year for the 1,983,609 English-language Wikipedia pages in appropriate categories which contain public domain images.','The authors make three policy recommendations: \n\n*Assist communities in valorising the public domain; members of the public participate as both consumers and stakeholders in relation to the public domain. As much as possible, members of the public and stakeholder communities should be offered the opportunity to be involved in curating, preserving and disseminating public  domain materials. Ideally, outputs should be of professional quality and should be presented in formats which are machine-readable, manipulable, and adaptable to different mediums (to facilitate downstream use).\n\n*As far as possible, clarify legal status of public domain; Government should provide guidance on those issues, in a format that is accessible to creators and businesses.  Educational initiatives should be aimed at helping UK firms understand what is likely  to  be  still  in copyright and what is likely to be in the public domain.  Increasing the strategic capabilities of the UK media sector with respect to intellectual property will likely increase licensing of copyright works alongside uptake of public domain materials – both types of usage require similar legal awareness and capacity.  \n\n*Improve access to information; many respondents focused their concern on transaction costs, as searching for and using public domain materials was often more costly than licensing a less-suitable copyright work or hiring-in a replacement original work,  disinhibiting creation. Information about availability and access to public domain  works will help entrepreneurs make strategic decisions. Centralised databases of works with associated metadata, such as the Wikimedia Commons project, have sought to overcome such problems in limited, specific contexts. Initiatives to increase the  centralisation and searchability of public domain data will likely lower these barriers to entry and encourage innovation and new products.','http://ssrn.com/abstract=2571220','https://zenodo.org/record/14975/files/CREATe-Working-Paper-2015-01.pdf',1,0,1,'Study 1: Commercial uptake by creative businesses\nThis  study  consisted  of  interviews  with  22 creative  businesses that  used  public  domain materials to create commercial products.\n\nStudy 2: Public domain projects on Kickstarter \nIn order to assess the role of public domain material in a crowdfunded creative marketplace, the  team  performed  quantitative  analysis  on  1,933 Kickstarter   projects from January to April 2014. \n\nStudy 3: Impact of availability of public domain images on Wikipedia \nTo assess the value of public domain images in the context of this resource, researchers studied the presence and impact of public domain images on biographical Wikipedia pages of 1,700 literary authors, lyricists and composers.'),('Erickson,_Kretschmer_and_Mendis_(2013)','Erickson, Kretschmer and Mendis (2013)','http://www.copyrightevidence.org/evidence-wiki/index.php/Erickson,_Kretschmer_and_Mendis_(2013)',2013,'Copyright and the Economic Effects of Parody: An Empirical Study of Music Videos on the YouTube Platform and an Assessment of the Regulatory Options','The status of parody and related derivative works within the UK copyright framework lacks clarity and has been recommended for further policy study in two recent independent reviews: the Gowers Review of Intellectual Property in 2006 and the more recent Hargreaves Review of Intellectual Property and Growth published in 2011.  \n\nThe review documents highlight the dual importance of parodic works both as a form of cultural expression and as a potential source of innovation and growth. A key recommendation made by Hargreaves is that the Government create a new fair dealing copyright exception for parody. However, a shortage of empirical data renders policy intervention in this area difficult. The issue is complicated by the inherently creative nature of parody, ambiguity about its definition and the multiplicity of \neconomic and legal approaches that may be applied. \n\nIn December 2011, following a call to tender procedure, the UK Intellectual Property Office (IPO) commissioned the Centre for Intellectual Property Policy and Management (CIPPM) at Bournemouth University to undertake research into the potential effects for rightsholders, creators and audiences of introducing a copyright exception for Parody in the UK. This synopsis reports the key findings from two complementary studies carried out by the researchers. Study I presents new empirical data about the rate and nature of parody content production on the online video platform YouTube, and its impact on commercial exploitation of original works where they can be considered to be part of the same market.  Study II distils regulatory options for a parody exception from a comparative review of seven jurisdictions. \n\nThe current synopsis document contains three parts. First, it discusses the empirical findings from Study I. A sample of 8,299 user-generated music video parodies was constructed relating to the top-100 charting music singles in the UK for the year 2011. Secondly, this synopsis presents a distilled discussion of the legal treatment of parodies in seven  jurisdictions  that  have  implemented  or  are  considering  implementing  a  copyright exception for parody (Australia, Canada, France, Germany, Netherlands, UK, and USA). The underlying  principles  (including  economic  and  constitutional)  governing  divergent  legal approaches are identified, and a list of policy options is presented. Thirdly, this synopsis document provides a synthesis of the legal analysis and the empirical data. Each of the policy options identified in Study II is examined for its likely impact on the empirical sample gathered in Study I. Finally, some recommendations are made.','The key findings are:\n\n*Parody is a significant consumer activity: On average, there are 24 user-generated parodies available for each original video of a charting single.\n\n*There is no evidence for economic damage to rights holders through substitution: The presence of parody content is correlated with, and predicts larger audiences for original music videos.\n\n*The potential for reputational harm in the observed sample is limited: Only 1.5% of all parodies sampled took a directly negative stance, discouraging viewers from commercially supporting the original.\n\n*Observed creative contributions were considerable: In 78% of all cases, the parodist appeared on camera (also diminishing the possibility of confusion).\n\n*There exists a small but growing market for skilled user-generated parody: Parodists who exhibit higher production values in their works attract larger audiences, which can be monetised via revenue share with YouTube.','The study outlines four key recommendations:\n\n*Avoid distinguishing between genres (satire, burlesque, etc.): Legislators and courts could struggle to classify works benefiting from an exception under copyright law, due to the high level of ambiguity inherent in this type of creation.  It is recommended that any policy be crafted in such a way as to minimise the need for subjective judgments about what constitutes humoristic or target parody, as opposed to other types of work.\n\n*In order to realise the benefits of economic growth, allow commercial parody: Providing a legal framework which allows amateurs and small producers to monetise their intellectual contributions will likely result in an increase in new works. \n\n*If an economic test is introduced, focus on incentive rationale and substitution effects: If policy makers want to resist (in Hargreaves’ words) ‘over-regulation of activities which do not prejudice the central objective of copyright, namely the provision of incentives to creators’, the focus needs to be on the threat of substitution of the original by the parody \n\n*Consider responsiveness to changing cultural and technological circumstances: It is recommended that any interpretation of intellectual input or transformative use remain sensitive to the rapidly changing cultural practices enabled by online tools.',NULL,'https://zenodo.org/record/8374/files/CREATe-Working-Paper-2013-04.pdf',1,0,1,'A sample of 8,299 user-generated music video parodies was constructed relating to the top-100 charting music singles in the UK for the year 2011.'),('EUIPO_2','EUIPO','http://www.copyrightevidence.org/evidence-wiki/index.php/EUIPO',2016,'Intellectual Property and Youth.','A 2013 study of what European citizens think about Intellectual Property Rights (IPRs) demonstrated that not everyone fully accepts the contribution to the economy they make and that young people in particular can be sceptical.\nIn response to these results the Office set out to try and better understand the attitudes of 15-24 year olds via the current IP Youth Scoreboard, which will be repeated on a regular basis to monitor evolution.\nThe Scoreboard covers young people in all 28 Member States and its main objective is to gather knowledge on how young people behave online in terms of Intellectual Property Rights.\nIn particular, it explores what are the main drivers and barriers to acquiring digital content and physical goods offered from both legal and illegal sources. \nFinally, the study assesses what could be done to improve the situation.','To briefly summarise a few of the main findings, the report reveals that young European citizens feel there is a lack of information about IP that would help them understand the issues. They also say that the information that is available is not communicated effectively to their age group. These factors combine to produce an atmosphere of indifference so that many young people who have been brought up in this digital age do not care whether they infringe IP or not.\nAround one third of the study respondents also identify the lack of availability of the films or television series that their colleagues from the US or other places have access to as a factor driving them to illegal sources.\nFinally, and possibly most importantly, two thirds of those polled identified price as a significant driver for using illegal sources.','To sum up the results of both qualitative and quantitative parts of the report, a good offer in terms of price and availability coupled with a well-designed communication\ncampaign including safety and moral arguments as well as information on what is legal and what is not and why, provided in a neutral tone and delivered by the right\nambassadors, is likely to be the most effective way to change the behaviours and attitudes of young people towards IP infringement.','https://euipo.europa.eu/tunnel-web/secure/webdav/guest/document_library/observatory/documents/IP_youth_scoreboard_study/IP_youth_scoreboard_study_en.pdf','https://euipo.europa.eu/tunnel-web/secure/webdav/guest/document_library/observatory/documents/IP_youth_scoreboard_study/IP_youth_scoreboard_study_en.pdf',1,0,1,'The study consists of qualitative data and quantitative data.

It was considered that \"The application or non-application of such a right has a significant impact on the competitive environment within the internal market, since the existence or absence of an obligation to pay on the basis of the resale right is an element which must be taken into account by each individual wishing to sell a work of art. This right is therefore a factor which contributes to the creation of distortions of competition as well as displacement of sales within the Community.\"\n\nConsistent with these aims, the Directive promoted harmonisation of the substantive conditions for the application of the resale right: (i) eligibility and the duration of protection; (ii) the categories of works of art to which the resale right applies; (iii) the scope of the acts to\nbe covered i.e. all acts involving dealers in works of art; (iv) the royalty rates applicable across defined price bands; (v) the maximum threshold for a minimum resale price attracting\nthe right (€3,000); and (vi) provisions on third country nationals entitled to receive royalties. The Directive came into force on 1 January 2006.\n\nAt the time the Directive was agreed 4 of the then 15 Member States did not apply the resale right in national law: Austria, Ireland, the Netherlands and the UK. These Member States enjoyed a transitional period to 1 January 2010 during which they could choose not to apply the resale right to the works of eligible deceased artists. These Member States, together with Malta, made use of this provision, and of the option to extend the derogation period for a further 2 years. This derogation comes to an end on 1 January 2012, at which point the Directive must be fully implemented in all Member States.\n\nArticle 11 of the Directive foresees that the Commission should submit to the European Parliament, the Council and the Economic and Social Committee a report on the implementation and the effect of the Directive. This report answers to that requirement. In line with the provisions of Article 11 this Report examines in particular the impact of the Directive on the internal market and the effect of the introduction of the resale right in those Member States that did not apply the right in national law prior to the entry into force of this Directive. It pays particular attention to the position of the Community in relation to relevant markets that do not apply the resale right, assesses the role of the Directive in the fostering of artistic creativity and reviews the situation with regard to the management procedures in the Member States.','No clear patterns can be established to link the loss of the EU\'s share in the global market for\nmodern and contemporary art with the harmonisation of provisions relating to the application of the resale right in the EU on 1 January 2006. Neither can any clear patterns currently be established that would indicate systematic trade diversion within the EU away from those Member States which introduced the right for living artists in 2006. Nevertheless, there are clearly pressures on European art markets, in all price ranges, and for both the auction and dealer sectors, and it is recalled that the scope of the application of the resale right will be significantly expanded following the ending of the derogation for the works of deceased artists on 1 January 2012.\nAt the same time, the quality of the administration of the resale right appears to vary considerably across the EU, bringing costs to art market professionals and artists alike. The burden can be particularly high for those at the lower end of the market who are proportionately more deeply affected by the costs of administering the right. The Commission recognises, furthermore, that in some Member States inefficient administration of the resale right presents a not insignificant burden on art market professionals and may also lead to unnecessarily high deductions from the royalties due to artists and their successors.','•In light of the economic significance of the sector, the Commission considers that market developments should be kept under review. The Commission will undertake a further reporting exercise and deliver its results in 2014.  The Commission will also pursue its commitment to persuading third countries to implement the resale right.\n• In light of the volume of transactions subject to the resale right, the European Commission also considers that there would be benefit in the exchange of best practice at European level with a view to managing and minimising the administrative costs in all Member states. To this end it intends to establish a Stakeholder Dialogue, tasked with making recommendations for the improvement of the system of resale right collection and distribution in the EU.\n• More broadly, the European Commission is concerned that collecting societies should operate to a high standard of governance and transparency with regard to their members and to commercial users, and will bring forward a proposal in this regard during 2012 to apply in equal measure to collecting societies administering the resale right.','http://ec.europa.eu/internal_market/copyright/docs/resale/report_en.pdf','http://ec.europa.eu/internal_market/copyright/docs/resale/report_en.pdf',1,0,1,'In preparing this Report, the Commission conducted a broad-based public consultation on all key questions identified in Article 11, including seeking information from Member States. 503 responses were received for publication.

The absence of a secure licensing framework is, however, a slight disadvantage with this option as far as legal certainty is concerned.\nThe option based on mutual recognition, on the other hand, could result in slightly higher operating costs for libraries, depending on whether Member States choose costly licensing systems to authorise the lawful display of orphan works. Nevertheless, the additional license substitutes for the requisite \"permission to use\" and would thus provide additional safeguards against subsequent infringement claims. Also, as long as a diligent search has been conducted, Member States can reduce operating costs by adopting rules that orphan works can be integrated into existing licensing schemes covering digital libraries.\nProperty rights are affected in the same manner by both options. Notwithstanding a prior diligent search, the orphan work is being used without the right holders\' express authorisation.\nHowever, since the mutual recognition option grants Member States the possibility to establish suitable instruments to substitute for an express authorisation, The mutual recognition option is better suited to allow Member States to provide a higher level of protection for property rights.','The chosen approach is therefore based on the mutual recognition of the orphan work status\ndetermined after a diligent search in the Member State where the work was first published.

Data generated by the public sector can be used as raw material for innovative value-added services and products which boost the economy by creating new jobs and encouraging investment in data-driven sectors. They also play a role in increasing government accountability and transparency. These benefits have recently been recognised by the G8 leaders and enshrined in an Open Data Charter.\n\nYet, studies conducted on behalf of the European Commission show that industry and citizens still face difficul ties in finding and re-using it. In response, in December 2011 the Commission adopted a package of measures (2) to overcome barriers to re-use and reduce the fragmentation of data markets. The key element was the recently adopted Directive 2013/37/EU amending Directive 2003/98/EC on the re-use of public sector information.\n\nThe amended Directive calls on the Commission to help the Member States implement the new rules by issuing guidelines on recommended standard licences, datasets and charging for the re-use of documents. The guide lines are an important element of the Commission’s efforts to help the EU’s economy to generate more value from data (including scientific data and ‘big data’ from other sources than the public sector). They will also facilitate the roll-out of open data infrastructures under the Connecting Europe Facility (CEF).\n\nIn August 2013, the Commission launched an online consultation followed by a public hearing and a meeting of a Member States expert group on PSI. The aim was to gather the views of all interested parties on the scope and content of the future Commission guidelines.  The purpose of this Commission Notice is to provide non-binding guidance on the best practices within the three subject areas of particular relevance for the re-use of public sector information in Europe.','The feedback received shows an increasing trend towards a more open and interoperable licensing system in Europe and agreement on the need for the speedy release of several high-value datasets. With regard to charging, it is clear that a wide range of approaches are in operation, but the newly introduced pricing principles were not called into question by the majority of respondents. The PSI re-use market in Europe is still under development and that guidance on the key elements of the recently revised Directive is urgently needed if full advantage is to be taken of the commercial and non-commercial opportunities offered by the re-use of public data.','Key recommendations on standard licences, licensing provisions, data release, and charging are laid out in this report for policy guidance.','http://ec.europa.eu/information_society/newsroom/cf/dae/document.cfm?action=display&doc_id=6421.','http://ec.europa.eu/information_society/newsroom/cf/dae/document.cfm?action=display&doc_id=6421.',0,0,0,'These recommendations are based a survey of 304 interested PSI re-users and analyses the feedback received in the period between 30.08.2013 and 22.11.2013, as a part of a public consultation on the future Commission guidelines on recommended standard licensing, datasets and charging for the re-use of public sector information.\nIn addition to the online survey, the consultation exercise included a public hearing open to all interested parties and a meeting of the Public Sector Information Group composed of the representatives of all EU Member States, held on 25-26th of November 2013 at the Commission\'s premises in Luxembourg.

The purpose is to horizontally assess intellectual property rights legal framework across Member States of the European Union.Members of the legal group drafted questionnaires to be distributed to legal practitioners in Member States. The responses of each Member State have been collated in tables with an executive summary for each. The authors have also outlined best practices or shortcomings and have added specific recommendations for each topic.','In implementing the EU’s Directive on the Civil Enforcement of Intellectual Property Rights (“IPRED”), Member States are required to provide compensation for various types of detriment suffered by the rightholder, which include lost sales and consequential damage (such as to the value of the brand). Member States also are required to award the rightholder the reasonable costs of investigating, taking legal action against, and rectifying the infringement.\nAs the IPRED has been implemented in national legislation and carried out in practice, however, the rightholder often cannot recover in full the compensation appropriate to an infringement, or the full costs that the rightholder has borne to redress the infringement. Some do not award compensation for all relevant types of damage. Many limit the types and amount of costs that can be recovered. Some courts are unwilling to award damages with respect to infringements and damage that clearly have taken place but are difficult to quantify precisely.\nThese legal and practical drawbacks mean that some of the profit or other economic benefit of an infringement often remains with the infringer even after the rightholder has brought a “successful” civil case, or that some of the cost of litigation or other cost of redressing that infringement is borne by the rightholder rather than by the infringer. As a result, damages and costs awards can effectively leave the rightholder in a worse position, and the infringer in a better position, than either would have been in had the infringement and the civil litigation not occurred. Such a state of affairs provides not a deterrent but rather an economic incentive to engage in infringement and an economic penalty for enforcing IPR rights through civil action.','Recommendations or current best practices for member States include:\n\n* Measures aimed at ensuring that rightholders are able to recover the totality of the losses sustained as a result of an infringement. \n* Measures that enable rightholders to recover their actual costs of investigating, taking legal action against, and rectifying an IPR infringement.\n* Measures designed to ensure that infringers do not retain any economic benefit from their infringing activities.','http://ec.europa.eu/internal_market/iprenforcement/docs/damages_en.pdf','http://ec.europa.eu/internal_market/iprenforcement/docs/damages_en.pdf',1,0,1,'Questionnaires were issued by the authors to 27 Member States of the European Union, to be answered by selected legal practitioners within each Member State.'),('European_Observatory_on_Infringement_of_IPRs_(2015)','European Observatory on Infringement of IPRs (2015)','http://www.copyrightevidence.org/evidence-wiki/index.php/European_Observatory_on_Infringement_of_IPRs_(2015)',2015,'European Observatory on Infringement of IPRs (2015).

Knowledge capital investment adds to the stock of intellectual property (IP) in the economy. Not all that investment is protected by IP rights (IPRs) such as copyright and patents: software is protected, but business processes are not. Thus this paper attempts to answer the following questions: (a) what proportion of knowledge investment is protected by IPRs; and (b) how much economic growth is therefore accounted for by such protected investment?','The main findings of this study are: \n\n* On average, between 2000 and 2008, approximately 48% of UK market sector investment in knowledge was protected by IPRs.\n\n* Approximately 75% of IPR investment is in assets protected by copyright and unregistered design rights.\n\n* In 2008, approximately 62% of the stock of knowledge assets in the UK market sector were protected by IPRs.\n\n* On average, between 1990 and 2008, 10.6% of growth in labour productivity was due to growth in the use of IPR-protected assets, similar to the 11.1% contribution of ICT equipment. The contribution of knowledge capital not protected by IPRs is around 10.3%, slightly less than that of protected IPRs.\n\n* We view our results as a lower bound of the total contribution of IPR-protected assets. Patents protect a specific innovation but reveal information to others for free. The same is true for other forms of IPR-protected knowledge. Such freely available information contributes to growth via total factor productivity (TFP) - effects on total output not caused by inputs -, which we estimate contributes around 45% of labour productivity growth.

Study I undertook a comparative international review of\nactual or proposed orphan works legislation, and identified key characteristics of orphan works\nlicensing schemes. Study II investigated the potential effects of such schemes by conducting a\nsimulated rights clearance exercise for six scenarios (establishing licence terms and fees for\nspecific commercial and non-commercial uses), and analysing the resulting dataset for effects\nof the characteristics identified in Study I.','* Two distinct approaches appear to be used for governing orphan works in the jurisdictions by collecting societies in Denmark. Interestingly, national central authorities have claimed that although no official negotiation process is provided by law, the price of licences is set on a case by case basis, after considering the individual circumstances of the applicant\n\n*  In Canada, Japan, India, Denmark and France an upfront payment is normally required by the applicant in exchange for using orphan works. In Canada, payment is upfront in approximately two-thirds of cases, whilst it is contingent on the rightholder reappearing in the remaining third.\n\n* In the US, in Hungary, and France a voluntary public online register for suspected orphan works is established. The EU is establishing a register at the Office for Harmonization in the Internal Market (OHIM). In Japan, some institutions have their own register of orphan works. No register is envisaged in India, Canada or Denmark (prior to the Orphan Works Directive). \n\n* There does not appear to be a standard price for licensing orphan works. \n\n* There is no systematic recognition of what may constitute an appropriate duration for licences.\n\n*  The report finds high tariffs that discourage mass digitisation projects. \n\n* The average level of fees imposed on a potential user of an orphan work is similar in collective and individual licensing regimes.\n\n*  A limited liability system seems to have advantages for archives and other non-profit institutions exposed to orphan works, enabling those organisations to share their stock of orphaned artefacts with the public. In contrast, the up-front rights clearing seems to provide more appropriate incentives for commercial uses of orphaned artefacts, guaranteeing that a reappearing rightholder will be compensated for the exploitation of any work.\n\n* The incentive problem is not mere speculation but reflected in actual user behaviour and shows that in particular in the US a limited liability system seems to enhance the availability of orphan works.','* The authors advocate the need for a more structured and consistent approach in governing orphan works that is reflected in the pricing and duration of licences, and in the costs of running any licensing system. \n\n* Licensing prices in extended collective licensing systems do not seem to be remarkably higher or lower than prices within other licensing systems. This implies that the associated cost with running collective and individual licensing systems may become an important criterion when implementing a new solution for the regulation of orphan works.\n\n*  According to the authors, a legislator must make a decision on what is deemed to be the desired behaviour. Thus, it seems feasible to consider both the limited liability and the up-front rights clearing as viable options but for different purposes. The limited liability system seems to have advantages for archives and other non-profit institutions exposed to orphan works enabling those organisations to actually share their stock of orphaned artefacts with the public. In contrast, up-front rights clearing seems to provide more appropriate incentives for commercial uses of orphaned artefacts guaranteeing that a re-appearing rightholder will be compensated for the exploitation of their work.','https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/312779/ipresearch-orphan-201307.pdf','https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/copyright-and-the-regulation-of-orphan-works',1,0,1,'Study I consists of a comparative international review of actual or proposed orphan works legislation.

Copyright scholars expressed concerns that TPMs do not comply with copyright exceptions and limits (Hugenholtz 2000; Koelman 2000; Dusollier 2003; Westkamp 2004). A few solutions to this problem have been proposed in the field of internet services (Mulligan and Burstein 2002; Erickson 2003; Cohen and Burk 2001; Sobel 2003). However, none of these proposals is tailored to optical disks (CDs and DVDs). Yet, the report ‘Digital Broadband Content: Music’ of the OECD (2005) states that TPMs implemented on optical disks hinder copyright exceptions more often than those applied to internet services. Moreover, in Europe the Copyright Directive exempts TPMs implemented on internet services from compliance with copyright exceptions. This paper therefore outlines possible ways to implement TPMs on optical disks in Europe, in order to achieve their compliance with a list of fundamental copyright exceptions, as identified by previous research (Favale 2008).','* Achieving a compliant DRM system harmonized at international level seems impossible in the light of the current state of the art.\n\n* Law is complex, articulated and unstable (subject to interpretations). When instructions are dictated by law, therefore, the gap between human-readable and machine-readable languages enlarges significantly. Approximation is therefore crucial to ‘streamline’ legal norms\n\n* To date no technical locks on optical disks (or on digital products on different carriers) have been implemented with the declared intent to comply with copyright exceptions.\n\n* With little modification, legal and technological instruments are already available to develop TPMs complying with copyright exceptions.','* The most indisputable copyright exceptions need to be identified, and optical disks have to embed fixed usage rules that allow copyright permitted uses. This paper suggests that achieving interoperability among carriers and fine-tuning copy-controlling TPMs would already get us very far down this road.\n\n* Other legal systems like the American, for example, could also develop similar models. To this end, they preliminarily need to identify a number of instances of fair use, possibly with the help of a third party\n\n* Approximation should consistently follow a rule in favour of the user. This seems more coherent with the ultimate goal of copyright protection: the circulation of culture and knowledge. \n\n*Approximation should be inversely proportional to the technological state of the art: more sophisticated DRM system would require less and less approximation.',NULL,'http://ijlit.oxfordjournals.org/content/early/2011/08/04/ijlit.ear010.abstract',0,0,0,'Alongside a literature review of works suggesting implementation of copyright exceptions in DRM, the author proposes a rule-set to be embodied and suggests a model of implementation based on a) a list of Primary Actors; b) a list of ‘Actions’ that each actor might be willing to perform; c) a list of machine-readable ‘Actions’ that have to be embedded in compliant TPMs.'),('Fetscherin,_Kaskiris_and_Wallenberg_(2005)','Fetscherin, Kaskiris and Wallenberg (2005)','http://www.copyrightevidence.org/evidence-wiki/index.php/Fetscherin,_Kaskiris_and_Wallenberg_(2005)',2005,'Gaming or sharing at LAN-Parties - What is going on?',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,0,0,0,''),('Fetscherin_(2005)','Fetscherin (2005)','http://www.copyrightevidence.org/evidence-wiki/index.php/Fetscherin_(2005)',2005,'Movie piracy on peer-to-peer networks—the case of KaZaA','Content providers from the movie industry argue that peer-to-peer (P2P) networks such as KaZaA, Morpheus, or Audiogalaxy are an enormous threat to their business.

Many of the posts are essentially asking “Is this going to get me into trouble?” or “How can I avoid getting into trouble?”\n* Many of the posters also note that they researched the issue first themselves and were confused by the law or unable to find satisfactory answers.\n* With regard to authors, posters often express frustration that there isn’t more that they can do to protect their work—for example, that the site moderators aren’t doing enough or that the site’s policies aren’t effective, sometimes making suggestions for policy or workflow changes.','* Unfortunately, copyright will continue to be a hard problem in online creative communities.

Social Distribution of Content” is an attempt at \nanalyzing the phenomenon of informal cultural content sharing in Poland. It describes \nhow books, music, and movies circulate among Poles who sometimes buy them, but more often than not acquire them via the Internet and borrow or copy them from friends. We focused our study on the comparison of formal and informal circulations of cultural content, in the form of either digital or cultural copies. We decided not to \nstudy broadcast media use, due to the lack of circulating copies that allow comparisons with informal circulations online. \nYet the public discussion, revolving around file sharing networks and more broadly \naround obtaining and making use of cultural content in a digital form, usually situates these practices on the margin of typical activities of Poles. Such practices still seem to be –as they are described in the public discussion- an embarrassing subject; stigmatized as an illegal activity that hurts legal content markets, creators, and intermediaries. \nWe conducted this research study in order to provide this public debate with an \nempirically absed descriptuon of the circulations of content in digital form and \nforemost on the Internet. And also to show the cultural and social aspects of this \nphenomenon that go beyond the question of its legality. First and foremost, we seek \nto explain why informal circulations of culture in digital form are an important issue for research on contemporary culture. Secondly, we stress that exploration into this issue provides important evidence for cultural policy.\nThe goal of our project was purely exploratory – instead of making rigid assumptionsin order to verify them, we decided to analyze the answers that the respondents put down in the questionnaires, their attitudes, and the opinions they expressed. This approach sought to help us understand how often, in what way, and why \nPoles engage with informal content circulations. \nMost importantly, we chose not to distinguish nor discriminate between legal and\nillegal circulations – mainly because the border between the two is often fuzzy and \nunclear for people who participate in either of them. Therefore, this is not a report \nabout “pirates” that conduct illegal activities, but rather about people who engage in informal content sharing practices. \nBut abandoning the simple legal-illegal binary has yet another reason. The goal of this report is to foster real dialogue on the issue of acquiring cultural content in Poland. The overuse of labels such as “piracy” or “theft” will not improve the chances of establishing such dialogue. An opposition between “formal” and “informal” is in our opinion a much better way for framing this debate.\nWe conducted a quantitative, survey study and one of our primary goal was to \nestablish the scale and general character of the informal content circulation –\nespecially the distribution of digital formats. The project consisted of two surveys. The first one, a pilot survey, was conducted through computer-assisted personal \ninterviews between May 19 and May 26 of 2011 on a sample of 1004 people over 15 \nyears of age, which was representative for the Polish population. \nThe goal of this survey was to describe the scale and basic characteristics of informal circulation in the whole Polish society. We were in particular interested in differences between Internet users and non-users, and between age groups. \nThe second survey was conducted over the Internet through computer-assisted web interviewson a sample of 1283 people. The survey was conducted on a random \nnationwide sample and the demographic structure of the analyzed set was representative of the Polish Internet user population (according to Nettrack) with \nrespect to gender, age (16 to 50 years old), place of residence, and education. \nWe have focused upon the population of Internet users based on the results of the first survey, according to which non-users do not participate in circulations of digital content.','Principal conclusions of the report:\n\n*13% of Poles purchase content, as opposed to 33% that obtain it through informal, digital circulations. Only 13% of Poles have purchased a book, a movie, or a musical recording in the year before the survey. Informal circulation is the second source of cultural content with the broadcast mass media like radio and TV being the first. The informal sphere covers 39% of Poles – thus being three times as large as the market-bound circulation of cultural content. \n\n*Engaging with the informal circulations of digital content strongly correlates with age. We should assume that populations ages 40 and older do not participate in smaller circulation of digital content.\n\n*The survey did not corroborate the thesis about informal circulations supplanting the formal ones. The people who most actively engage in the informal content circulations (i.e. Internet users who download files) constitute the largest segment of the purchasers. They comprise 32% of all people purchasing books, 31% of all people purchasing movies, and over half of all people who buy music. The 15 to 24 age group made up the biggest part of the group of people that both purchase content and download it from the Internet – despite common assumptions that younger generations lack funds to purchase content. \n\n*A quarter of all Poles engage with the informal circulation without purchasing any content from the formal circulations. Membership in this group is strongly linked  with age – the percentage of such people is much higher in the younger age groups,  while significantly dropping off in age groups over 50. \n\n*62% of Poles do not participate in either the formal or the informal circulations of cultural content. The primary form of cultural activity for most Poles is probably watching television and listening to the radio. \n\n*The average Internet user buys three times more books and movies and seven times more music in comparison with people who don’t use the Internet. Internet usage is the primary distinguishing factor when it comes to interest in cultural content, which is furthercorrelated with age and education. More importantly, these differences are even more pronounced where accessing content doesn’t require any financial commitment, such as borrowing books, movies, or music. \n\n*Active Internet users are a group especially inclined to participate in circulations of culture. Strong differences are revealed when Internet users are split into less active and more active ones: 88% of active Internet users participate in the informal circulation of music, 73% participate in informal book circulation, and 78% engage in informal movie circulation (in the three months preceding the survey). 72% of active internet users claim to have downloaded files from the Internet – e.g. from file-sharing networks or from file hosting services. \n\n*92% of active users claim to have engaged in informal circulations if their definition is expanded to include all avenues of content access (such as streaming, sharing files with friends, etc.). If we include the informal circulation of content stored on physical media (e.g. sharing and copying books or CDs and DVDs) in the aforementioned definition, then practically all of the respondents (95%) claim to have engaged in such content circulations. \n\n*75% of active internet users indicated price and a wider selection of content available on the Internet as justifications for their behavior. Two-thirds of them pointed to such factors as availability without delays (typical of formal circulations, where global content arrives in Poland often with a delay) or the selection available.\n\n*Internet distribution impacts the way active internet users interact and use media formats. Only 8% of people who download music from the Internet download entire albums only; 31% download both albums and single files, while 61% download strictly single audio files. \n\n*The most commonplace attitude of active Internet users (50% of respondents) towards the informal circulations is moderate and focused on the broadening of cultural horizons. For them, the crucial factor is the ability to know more and see more, not acquire free content. \n\n*Additionally, two countervailing attitudes exist between fans of the informal circulation (8%), who think that “everyone’s downloading content,” and its staunchest critics (11%), who claim that downloading is theft and that the law should be more stringent with people who acquire content from the Internet via illegal means. \n\n*A fourth group (13%) claims that “downloading is simply easier.” Interestingly, prices do not discourage them from acquiring content from the formal circulations, but rather the inconvenience of using the formal channels, that are not present when engaging the informal ones.','Policy implications:\n\n*Considering the extent of the informal circulation and its coexistence next to the formal circulation, cultural policy cannot be based on a binary separation of the two circulations, the people participating in them and stigmatization of one group. \n\n*Cultural policy cannot be based on the assumption that one circulation will be replaced by the other and we can’t let that happen. If we do, then we will arrive at the conclusion that this substitution is furthered not only by the negatively-branded Internet phenomena, but also by the commonplace sharing of  content in the household, and even the activity of public cultural institutions, the latter also enabling us to access content via non-market means. \n\n*We’re already facing situations where access to content that’s allowed from the standpoint of the Polish legal system is hindered by technological instruments. The state, with its instruments that are supposed to regulate that sphere, has to look for balance between the interest of copyright owners and the public good. Favoring either side of the issue is completely unacceptable. \n\n*Cultural policy should be based on the assumption that multiple content circulations can coexist and might frequently overlap. And the goal of cultural policy should be the establishment of institutions and cultural frameworks that will harness these various circulations to foster creativity, as well as the possibility to use it, while remaining grounded in facts and considering the arguments of all involved parties.','http://obiegikultury.centrumcyfrowe.pl/the_circulations_of_culture_report.pdf','http://obiegikultury.centrumcyfrowe.pl/en',0,0,0,'The project consisted of two surveys. \n\nThe first one was a nationwide pilot survey based on computer assisted personal interviewing (CAPI), conducted from May 19 to May 26 of 2011 by Millward Brown SMG KRC company, on a representative sample of 1004 persons over 15 years of age. \n\nThe second survey took a deeper look into the mechanisms of acquiring and recommending content.

The probability of consumers engaging in unlawful product acquisition is not higher in the tasks where the rights holder has high wealth (£22) than in the tasks in which the rights holder has low wealth (£4).\n* H6 is supported. The probability of the consumer engaging in unlawful product acquisition is lower in the conditions where the rights holder has exerted effort than in the treatments in which the rights holder has exerted no effort.

In this paper, we suggest that this diversity of legal rules is largely traceable to differences in the audience in IP cases. Patent, trademark, copyright, and design patent each focus on a different person as the fulcrum for evaluating IP infringement. The fact that patent law focuses on an expert audience while trademark looks to a consumer audience explains many of the differences in how patent and trademark cases are decided. Expert audiences are likely to evaluate infringement based on the technical similarity between the plaintiff’s and defendant’s works. Consumers, by contrast, are likely to pay more attention to market substitution and less attention to how things work under the hood. Understanding the different audiences in IP infringement is critical to understanding how the IP regimes define infringement.','*There are some technological areas in which patent law does not in practice heed its general rule of choosing the expert as audience. The most notable example involves software patents. In this area, because the Federal Circuit allows software to be claimed based on its function rather than on its more detailed technical workings, infringement can be found when two computer programs serve the same function, even if the software works in very different ways.81 A consumer or ordinary reasonable observer might use the purpose the software serves to assess similarity more generally, but a software expert would not.With few exceptions, then, the expert is the audience for patent infringement. For this audience choice to work, the fact finder must be able to put herself in the position of the expert. Patent law tries to address this challenge by relying on expert witnesses to explain the technology while limiting the amount of post hoc expert testimony on the meaning of patent claims and relying instead on documentary materials in existence at the time of patent filing. Patent law also gives the judge the role of assigning meaning to patent terms. Even though that job is really fact finding, not legal interpretation, it is arguably better suited to judges than juries because of their increased exposure to patent-infringement suits.\n\n* Copyright law’s use of varied infringement audiences is confused and often depends on the particular circuit deciding the case. As a general matter, however, copyright uses a hybrid test, drawing on both the perspective of the expert and that of a nonexpert observer (either the consumer or the ordinary person).\n\n* Patent and trademark are virtual antipodes when it comes to the audience used to assess infringement. Patent law focuses on a hypothetical audience of experts, while trademark law ostensibly cares about both actual consumers’ reactions and the defendant’s subjective intent. The test for infringement of a design patent draws much more from trademark than from patent law. Infringement is judged in the eye of an ordinary observer, giving such attention as a purchaser usually gives. This test evokes an actual audience composed of reasonable purchasers, just as the trademark test does. But the audience is asked a different question. Despite the fact that the Supreme Court has spoken of “the resemblance . . . such as to deceive such an observer, inducing him to purchase one supposing it to be the other,” the Federal Circuit has held that in design patent law, it is the similarity between the claimed design and the defendant’s product, not the likelihood of confusion, that determines infringement. The result is a hybrid: the consumer audience from trademark law, asked to make the rather more abstract assessment of expert-based technical similarity from patent or copyright law. \n\n* Because consumers as a class tend to focus on whether the uses for two products are interchangeable, the consumer is likely to be the audience that most directly measures whether the plaintiff’s work and the defendant’s work at issue in IP litigation substitute for one another in the marketplace. When the consumer is the audience for IP infringement, then, market substitutes are more likely to be deemed infringing and thus third parties will be discouraged from producing substitutes without permission from the rights holder. For this reason, the consumer is an ideal audience choice for assessing IP infringement when that form of IP law seeks to discourage third parties from creating or distributing market substitutes of works protected by an IP right.\n\n* Different audiences (and fact finders, for that matter) can readily provide varying determinations on infringement. The choice of audience therefore ought to be made carefully with regard to the desired goals of each form of IP law. Understanding this fact helps explain many of the differences in IP infringement doctrine.','As a normative matter, the authors argue that IP infringement—across trademark, patent, copyright, and design patent laws—should generally require proof both that the two works are sufficiently similar in their novel aspects (technical similarity) and that the defendant’s use interferes with the plaintiff’s market (market substitution). Many of the problems in IP law come from decisions that neglect one aspect or the other.

It concludes that many American law journals have adopted copyright policies that are inconsistent with the expectations of legal scholars and the scope of copyright protection. Specifically, many law journals have adopted copyright policies that effectively preclude open-access publishing, and unnecessarily limit the fair use of copyrighted works. In addition, it appears that some law journals may not understand their own copyright policies. This article proposes the creation of a Code of Copyright Best Practices for Law Journals in order to encourage both open-access publishing and fair use.','* Responses indicate that the sample is composed mostly of journals that do not classify themselves as IP content journals. That is, 7.52 percent indicate that they exclusively publish IP articles, and another 8.89 percent indicated that they frequently publish IP articles. An overwhelming proportion of journals in the sample indicated that they do publish IP articles but only occasionally (32.61 percent) or rarely (34.78 percent). A significant proportion indicated that they do not publish IP articles (16.30 percent).\n\n*The sample contains a substantial majority of journals who make their article content available online before or contemporaneous with the publication of an issue (71.43 percent), while 9.89 percent indicated that online publication was not immediate or depended on the circumstances. Last, 17.58 percent of journals in our sample indicated that their policy is not to make journal content publicly available online.\n\n* In terms general copyright practices on average, they observe that practices of journals in our sample vary greatly with regard to their copyright assignment and public dissemination policies. For instance, while most journals do not ask authors to assign copyright in their articles (48.91 percent), almost as many journals do ask authors to assign copyright in their articles (42.39 percent). Also, most journals in the sample ask authors not to publicly disseminate their article before publication: 21.98 percent of journals prohibit public dissemination before publication, 14.29 percent ask but do not require authors not to publicly disseminate articles before publication, and 21.98 percent of journals will ask authors not to publicly disseminate depending on the circumstances. However, 38.46 percent of journals responding to the survey do not ask authors not to publicly disseminate their work prior to publication. \n\n* More consensus among journals in the sample emerges around the issues of exclusive publication, republication credits, and third party republication agreements. Most journals (52.22 percent) require authors to sign an exclusive publication agreement. Only 25.56 percent of journals do not ask authors to sign exclusive publication agreements at all, while 20.00 percent do ask authors to sign exclusive publication agreements but--depending on the circumstances--do not require the author’s exclusive publication agreement. Additionally, an overwhelming majority of journals (73.63 percent) require credits upon the republication of the author’s article, and 10.99 percent ask authors for a republication credit but may not require it, leaving just 12.09 percent of journals that do not ask for such a credit. Finally, responses show that journals in the sample tend to grant third parties to republish or otherwise distribute the journals’ articles. While most journals grant third party republication permission with a credit (43.96 percent), others require payment of a licensing fee (8.79 percent), while others yet permit third party republication without restriction (4.40 percent). A significant number of journals indicated that third party republication permission depended on the circumstances (29.67 percent), while 5.49 percent of journals do not allow third party re-publication. Finally, 7.69 percent of journals responded that they did not know whether their journal allowed third party re-publication.\n\n* The analysis suggests that legacy policies at law journals may create unnecessary barriers to open access as well as impact scholars’ abilities to use certain kinds of materials in their articles. This is evidenced by the significant number of journal respondents indicating that they: (1) require copyright transfers; (2) exclusive copyright agreements; and (3) not permitting the public dissemination of articles by the author prior to publication. Additionally, considerable confusion about when to seek permission from an original author to reproduce a copyrighted work, even for uses which would fall under the coverage of an educational use, is presented by','* This empirical study of the copyright practices of American law journals shows that many law journals have adopted copyright policies that are inconsistent with open access publishing and fair use doctrine. Many law journals stated that their copyright policies require assignment of the copyright in the articles they publish, which may conflict with open access publishing. Many law journals stated that their copyright policies prohibit alternative distribution of articles before or after publication, which directly conflicts with open access publishing. Many law journals stated that their copyright policies require authors to obtain permission to use elements of copyrighted works in ways that are clearly protected by the fair use doctrine. And many law journals provided implausible answers that suggest that they do not understand their own copyright policies.\n\n* The study suggests that law journals would benefit from the creation and adoption of a “Code of Copyright Best Practices for Law Journals.” Such a code of best practices would help law journals evaluate and improve their copyright policies relating to ownership and fair use.

According to this critique, the over-expansion of IP rights throughout the past two decades harms competition, chills free speech, and diminishes the public domain as increasingly broad areas of social life are brought within the scope of strong IP protection. While this over-expansion theory reflects an important - indeed, foundational - policy debate concerning the proper balance between IP owners\' rights and the public\'s rights of access to the information, ideas, and expressions\nthat IP protects, it is incomplete because it focuses largely on what Congress or the courts do. In reality, most enforcement of IP rights takes place not in court, but in the everyday practices of IP owners and their lawyers. \"Cease and desist\" letters, phone calls, and negotiations with alleged infringers constitute the bulk of IP enforcement efforts in trademark and copyright practice. To be sure, these efforts take place in the \"shadow\" of IP law and are therefore influenced by it. But it is in these everyday practices - and not in trial or appellate courts - that most IP rights are asserted, resisted, and negotiated. Thus, if we want to know whether IP rights are over-enforced or over-extended, we need to know how, why, and to what effect these\nrights are exercised in the everyday practices of IP owners and their lawyers. To date, however, IP scholarship has focused virtually no attention on this critical arena of everyday practice. This Article presents findings from a qualitative empirical study of the trademark and copyright disputing process outside of court, based on original data derived from semi-structured interviews with experienced\nIP attorneys who advise clients on how to enforce their rights. This research is one of the first studies to examine how trademark and copyright claims are actually enforced in practice. One significant finding from this study is that \"repeat player\" trademark and copyright owners (and their lawyers) knowingly assert weak IP claims at times - precisely because it works, as enforcement targets are unable or unwilling to resist claims that may lack legal merit due to the costs and uncertainties of threatened litigation. Moreover, the lawyers who assert weak IP claims have ready practical and ethical justifications for their actions. This study also suggests that legal sanctions directed at deterring over-reaching IP enforcement are unlikely to be effective because most such over-reaching occurs in informal disputing processes outside of the legal system.','Main results: \n\n*Trademark and copyright lawyers and their clients sometimes enforce admittedly weak IP claims precisely because it can be an effective strategy with few downsides. \n\n*Aggressive trademark and copyright enforcement efforts often work, as enforcement targets frequently choose to capitulate or settle rather than resist claims on the legal merits, likely due to the costs and uncertainties inherent in IP litigation. \n\n*The study supports the thesis that trademarks and copyrights can be and often are over-enforced in everyday legal practice. \n\n*The lawyers in this study had few ethical concerns about enforcing even weak trademark and copyright claims, as the uncertainties of law and an asserted ethical duty to zealously advocate client interests were readily invoked to justify aggressive policing of IP rights. \n\n*The study delineates some of the perceived advantages that “repeat player” IP owners may enjoy when enforcing their IP rights, and it also demonstrates some of the factors that limit the ability and willingness of IP owners to enforce their rights. \n\n*Trademark and copyright owners may be able to “bully” enforcement targets, but only when they do not fear the backlash of negative publicity and public opinion that can accompany such efforts.','Policy implications: \n\nFuture empirical scholarship that focuses on IP disputing in action should build on these insights and contribute to a growing understanding of the significance of private disputing in shaping the effective scope of trademark and copyright owners’ rights.','http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1990588','http://www.lexisnexis.com.ezproxy.lib.gla.ac.uk/uk/legal/search/homesubmitForm.do',0,0,0,'Semi-structured interviews were conducted with experienced lawyers who regularly enforce trademarks and copyrights on behalf of their clients.

A significant amount of literature has been published on the application of competition rules to premium content rights agreements, but the specific obstacles encountered by new media platforms have been relatively unexplored. This paper seeks to fill this gap in the literature. \n\nThe European Commission (hereafter, the Commission) has recognised in its decisions that premium content is an \"essential input\" for operators active in the delivery of audio-visual content. There is indeed no substitution possible with other less attractive forms of content. In fact, premium content such as major football events represents \"stand-alone\" driver content for pay-TV operators. Absent access to such content it is very difficult for a content delivery operator to gain or retain market shares. Access to premium content is thus a matter of life or death for such operators. \n\nYet, getting access to premium content is not an easy matter. First, premium content is scarce as there are only a few blockbusters and a limited number of premium sport events every year. Moreover, premium content rights contracts usually involve some form of exclusivity pursuant to which dominant pay-TV operators often manage to monopolize such rights for several years at the expense of weaker competitors. The combination of scarcity and exclusivity has translated into a spiralling of the costs involved in buying premium content. For instance, while in 1992, broadcasters paid 434 million euros for the TV rights of the English Premier League, in 2000, they paid 2,6 billion euros for only three seasons. \n\nThe lack of access to premium content represents a significant handicap for new entrants, such as new media platforms. If these platforms want to gain market share, they need to show programmes, which are able to compete with the content shown by dominant pay-TV operators. Access foreclosure to premium content would thus not only prevent new entries from taking place in the highly concentrated pay-TV market, but would also affect technological developments and consumer choice as the latter would be prevented from watching their favourite programmes on the platform of their choice. Thus, in a number of policy speeches, Commission officials have insisted on the importance that new media platforms gain access to premium content. \n\nThe main argument followed throughout the paper is that, while recent Commission decisions contain remedies, which will help new media platforms to gain access to premium content, such remedies are insufficient to create a level playing field in the market for the acquisition of such content.

Knowing whether a photo, painting, film, or original letter was published is critically important to anyone who wants to use it today. Before 1989, publishing a work with no copyright notice dedicated the work to the public domain. Unpublished works without a notice are likely protected by copyright, and their unauthorized use can result in severe federal penalties. Unfortunately, the meaning of “publication” in copyright law is notoriously ambiguous. The federal statutory definition suggests that works “made available” to the public are published, while leading treatises generally assume that works given to public museums and libraries are unpublished. Confronted with this uncertainty, risk averse institutions too often assume that archived works are protected by copyright. Misunderstanding the law can keep cultural treasures locked in dark archives, vaults and basements, preventing their use as a foundation for new expression and distorting our sense of history.\n\nThis Article critically examines mistaken assumptions about copyright publication. It finds that neither the statutory definition nor leading treatises adequately identify when a work is published. A better standard for determining when a work is published and in the public domain is needed to free works from being locked up by copyright uncertainty. The best solution would clarify the boundaries of a stable public domain. In a recent decision, the Supreme Court took a wrong turn in dismissing the importance of the public domain. Knowing what content may be freely used is critical to preserving First Amendment values and freeing cultural treasures from copyright’s bondage. The copyright ambiguity of archived works should be resolved in a way that honors the expressive and historical value of the public domain. After considering several alternatives, this Article shows how precedential patterns point to the best solution to the publication ambiguity. Drawing on empirical analysis of federal cases interpreting copyright publication, I identify the variables that are most important in determining whether archived works are published. The suggested solution focuses on copyright owner intent and the availability of authorized copies. Other factors described as significant in leading treatises — such as the type of work or archive — actually mask these two fundamental inquiries. The proposed standard provides a much needed solution to clarify which pieces of our cultural heritage are in the public domain and freely available as raw materials for educational sharing, expressive work, historical research, and public discourse.','* In the six categories of text, 2D art, 3D art, music, film and all, district courts found works to be published 71% of the time.\n* With visual art, courts often found publication. In eight of the ten categories (photograph, painting, drawing, print, audiovisual work, sculpture fine art, sculpture, fabric design, architectural work, and map), publication findings exceeded the 71% average. Six categories (photographs, drawings, prints, sculpture, fabric design, and maps) exceed the average by more than 10 percentage points. The two lowest categories (audiovisual works at 45% and architectural works at 46%) were found to be published much less frequently.\n* The presence of authorized copies is the one variable that significantly increases (by 28%) the probability of finding publication. \n* With publication by deposit in archives, 64% of courts found works to be unpublished. \n* Although the copyright statute defines publication to include “rental, lease or lending,” the regression analysis revealed that courts were less likely to find a work published when they reported these distributions. In the 51 district court opinions addressing such works, courts found publication 47% of the time (well below the 71% average).','* The optimal solution is as follows: a work will be deemed “published” under copyright law if it was placed in a public archive by the copyright owner, and the archive did not impose copying restrictions. Publication before January 1, 1978 would establish public domain status for U.S. works not marked with a valid copyright notice. \n* Such a solution would enable museums, libraries, publishers, authors, filmmakers, and artists to rely on a clear test to determine the copyright status of many archived works. It would increase public access to works now obscured by an ambiguous copyright posture.','http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2505041',NULL,0,0,0,'The empirical dataset consists of 446 federal copyright publication opinions decided before 2011.'),('Gerhardt_(2011)','Gerhardt (2011)','http://www.copyrightevidence.org/evidence-wiki/index.php/Gerhardt_(2011)',2011,'Copyright Publication: an Empirical Study','The Article presents the first empirical study of copyright publication, a concept that can mark a critical moment in the life of a creative work. Books, magazines, films, software and plays, as well as works of art, architecture, music, and even choreography may be protected by copyright. For works created before 1976, knowing whether a work is published is often necessary for determining whether it is in the public domain so that anyone can use it, copy it or adapt it in other media without risking copyright liability. A court’s determination of whether a work is published also may be dispositive of issues such as the duration of the copyright, if others can make fair use of it and whether, in litigation, statutory damages and attorney’s fees are available. Despite the obvious import of this concept, it remains one of the most ambiguous features of copyright law. How do judges decide whether a creative work is published? This article presents the first comprehensive and systematic answer to that question. Based on a dataset of federal judicial opinions, this article analyzes the extent to which accepted notions of copyright publication conform with legal doctrine. The results reveal that often they do not. In particular, this article demonstrates that publication has a surprisingly inconsistent meaning across copyright issues, differing dramatically between the public domain and fair use contexts. The analysis shows that the characteristics of the work, as well as how it is distributed and accessed are important to courts when deciding whether a work is in the public domain. These findings are especially noteworthy, since contrary to popular belief, courts increasingly encounter the issue of publication when answering a wide variety of copyright questions. Drawing upon the empirical findings, the Article recommends that the commonly used definitions of publication be changed to reflect the factors upon which judges actually rely in deciding these cases.','Publication is still of great importance in judicial outcomes of copyright cases.  Judges treat publication in accordance with the copyright question in the case (e.g., differently in a fair use case and a public domain case).  Therefore, the current statutory definition of publication is insufficient and does not reflect the practical application and consideration of publication.','Statutory changes should be made to more accurately reflect judicial and practical applications of publication.','http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2016033','http://www3.nd.edu/~ndlrev/archive_public/87ndlr1/Gerhardt.pdf',0,0,0,'Cases were selected by (1) reviewing U.S.C.A. note references to the copyright\nstatutes that mention “publish” or “publication,” (2) reviewing references in copyright texts, law review articles, and treatises, and (3) conducting keyword searches through LEXIS and Westlaw.  446 cases were selected of over 800 reviewed.'),('GfK_Belgium_(2015)','GfK Belgium (2015)','http://www.copyrightevidence.org/evidence-wiki/index.php/GfK_Belgium_(2015)',2015,'Provision of two online consumer surveys as support and evidence base to a Commission study:\nIdentifying the main cross-border obstacles to the Digital Single Market and where they matter most','The present report was based on data collected within the scope of a wider investigation that feeds into one of the Commission’s top priorities: to create a borderless Digital Single Market (DSM) across Europe. The Commission’s DSM strategy for Europe, announced on May 6, 2015, aims to provide better access to tangible and digital goods and services, to create the right environment for the development and commercial success of digital innovation, and to maximise the growth of the digital economy across the EU28. As support and evidence base, two surveys of online consumers were carried out, looking particularly into their purchase activity for 12 types of tangible goods and offline services (e.g. clothes, travel services), usage of 4 types of online services (e.g. communication services) and access to 8 types of digital content (e.g. e-books). These included a core survey (covering online consumers from all EU28, Norway and Iceland) and a clickstream survey (targeted to online respondents from Belgium and Poland only who had expressed the intention to make at least one immediate online purchase). The main objectives of the study were: 1) to examine the current state of play of cross-border e-commerce in the EU28 and 2) to identify the main drivers and barriers to the proper functioning of a DSM across the EU.','*  The total market value of the consumer segment of the Digital Single Market is estimated at ~ €231 billion. Tangible goods and offline services represent 92% of the total market value, with digital content and online services accounting for only 6% and 2%, respectively. The combined share of cross-border purchasing was one fifth (20%) of the total market value for tangible goods/offline services and digital content markets (14% inside the EU). \n\n* A much higher market penetration was observed for tangible goods and offline services when compared to online services and digital content. The proportion of EU28 online respondents who purchased tangible goods and offline services online at least once in the last 12 months was as high as 95%, whereas the corresponding proportions of respondents purchasing online services and digital content online were significantly smaller (20% and 44% respectively). This reflects the fact that a considerable proportion of online services and digital content is currently being provided for free. Nonetheless, survey results indicate that online services and digital content are used or accessed (instead of purchased) online at least once in the last 12 months at percentages comparable to the online purchases of tangible goods (93% for online services and 94% for digital content).\n\n* Data protection, payment security and consumer rights are key concerns in domestic ecommerce. \n\n* The average time online shoppers spent in total on their most recent online purchase was 3.1 hours.

The increased viability of these used book markets has caused concern among groups such as\nthe Book Publishers Association and Author’s Guild who believe that used book markets will\nsignificantly cannibalize new book sales.\nThis proposition, while theoretically possible, is based on speculation as opposed to empirical\nevidence. In this research, we use a unique dataset collected from Amazon.com’s new and used\nmarketplaces to estimate the impact of IT-enabled used book markets on new book sales. We use\nthese data to calculate the impact of these secondary market exchanges on consumer and publisher\nwelfare by calculating the cross-price elasticity of new books sales with respect to used\nbook prices.\nOur analysis suggests that IT-enabled secondary market exchanges increase consumer surplus by\napproximately $70 million annually. Further, we find that only 15% of used book sales at Amazon\ncannibalize new book purchases. The remaining 85% of used book sales apparently would\nnot have occurred at Amazon’s new book prices. This low cannibalization means that book publishers\nlose only $32 million in gross profit annually (about 0.2% of total gross profit) due to the\npresence of Amazon’s used book markets. Further, the additional used book readership gain\nfrom these electronic markets may mitigate author losses through increased revenue from secondary\nsources such as speaking and licensing fees.

They find that the while 29.9 million used book sales took place in 2002 on Amazon.com’s site, only 4.5 million of these sales cannibalized new book sales. The remaining sales apparently would not have occurred at Amazon’s new book price. While these cannibalized sales result in an estimated $31.9 million loss to publishers annually, the total welfare gain to society from this IT-enabled market is $102.4 million annually after considering the $64.1 million gain in Amazon.com’s gross profits and the $70.2 million gain in consumer surplus.','The implication of this finding for publishers is that, at least at the present, used book markets do not significantly cannibalize new book sales — even in a market that lists used copies side by side with new.

We find that the number of high-quality operas also increased – measured both by their contemporary popularity and by the longevity of operas. By comparison, evidence for a significant effect of copyright extensions is limited. Our analysis of alternative mechanisms for this increase reveals a substantial shift in composer migration in response to copyrights. Consistent with agglomeration externalities, we also find that cities with a better pre-existing infrastructure of performance spaces benefitted more copyright laws.','The paper uses data collected specifically by the authors to test the hypothesis that creativity (in terms of quantity and quality as in durability of the works) is increased by copyright. The test analyses differences in these data by Italian state starting from 1801, contrasting effects of two states where there was copyright from that date with output in other states that did not until much later. The findings are that the presence of copyright increase output and stimulated composer migration. The study does not find any effect for extensions of copyright.\n* Summary statistics on the changes in the number of new operas produced per state and year show that opera production increased significantly after Lombardy and Venetia adopted copyrights (from 1.55 new operas per state and year to 4.48 – a 189% increase). By comparison, in states that did not offer copyrights, production increased only 54% (from 1.36 to 2.10).\n* The creation of copyright may also have influenced by increasing the quality of new operas if composers had an intrinsic preference for producing high quality works, and if the additional revenue from copyrights relaxed their budget constraint enough to allow them to substitute quality for quantity. \n* Summary statistics indicate that composers in copyright state began to produce significantly more high-quality operas after its introduction in 1801 (composers premiers increased from 0.125 per year to 0.619 – a 396% increase).

Understanding the factors that determine attitude toward softlifting is important in order to ascertain what motivates individuals to engage in the behavior. We examine a number of factors, including personal moral obligation (PMO), perceived usefulness, and awareness of the laws and regulations governing software acquisition and use, along with facets of personal self-identity that may play a role in the development of attitudes and therefore intentions regarding this behavior. These factors are examined across multiple settings expected to be pertinent to our survey respondents: home, work and school. Personal moral obligation and perceived usefulness are significant predictors of attitude across all settings. Past behavior is a significant predictor of intention across all settings, and a significant predictor of attitude in the home setting. We find evidence that awareness of the law causes a less favorable evaluation of softlifting in the school setting only, but has little effect in the home and work settings. As in previous studies, attitude is a significant predictor of intent. We do not find indications that one\'s personal self-identity influences one\'s attitude towards the behavior and the intention to perform it, except in the case of legal identity, where marginally significant effects are found in the work environment.','Main results of the study:\n\n*Perceived usefulness is shown to positively influence an individual\'s attitude toward softlifting. \n\n*Additionally, one\'s moral obligation to avoid softlifting is significantly and negatively related to attitude toward this behavior. Prior research suggests that the moral component is an integral part of attitude and the empirical data strongly support this claim.\n\n*Risk-taking personal identity is positively related to one\'s attitude toward softlifting. However, this relationship is only moderately significant (a = 0.10), and only in the school setting. \n\n*Gender was not a significant factor in any setting. Previous research finds that males had a more favorable attitude towards software piracy than females, and suggests that one possible explanation might be that males were greater risk-takers. This study finds evidence to support the explanation offered by those prior studies.\n\n*Legal personal identity is negatively related to one\'s attitude toward softlifting but this relation is only moderately significant (a = 0.10), and only in the work setting. The ability to detect this effect may be limited by the single-item measure used in this study. Nonetheless, the results support the expectation of a negative effect of legal personal identity on attitude; this seems a promising avenue for further research.\n\n*Awareness of the law is significant in reducing a favorable attitude toward softlifting, but only at school, where a student runs a greater risk of loss of privileges or a blemish on his or her record.\n\n*The research model is able to explain over 60% of the variance in attitude toward softlifting in all settings. Prior studies involving the Theory of Reasoned Action, the Theory of Planned Behavior and the Technology Acceptance Model have shown that attitude is an important determinant of behavioral intention. \n\n*It is therefore important to understand the determinants of attitude in order to comprehend the reasons that such behavior exists. This model demonstrates that with a behavior that has a moral component (such as softlifting), personal moral attitude and legal personal identity are important in explaining attitude toward the behav- ior. \n\n*Additionally, perceived usefulness is significant as well. This model could possibly be useful in predicting other behaviors that include a strong moral component.\n\n*In addition to significant findings regarding the determinants of attitude toward softlifting, this research shows that when examining software piracy behavior, setting matters. Future research along these lines could produce intriguing results.','Policy implications: \n\n*A more effective approach to curtailing software piracy may be to gain a fuller understanding of how the roots of that behavior, specifically intention to commit software piracy and the antecedents of intent are formed among individuals. Then perhaps more effective measures to slow or prevent undesirable behavior such as software piracy may be developed.',NULL,'http://link.springer.com.ezproxy.lib.gla.ac.uk/article/10.1007/s10551-007-9361-0',0,0,0,'The sample for the study was drawn from the population of students in the business school of a state university.

We first estimate a structural consumer level demand system for satellite, basic cable, premium cable and local antenna using micro data on almost 30000 households in 317 markets, including extensive controls for unobserved product quality and allowing the distribution of unobserved tastes to follow a fully flexible multivariate normal distribution. The estimated elasticity of expanded basic is about -15, with the demand for premium cable and DBS more elastic. The results identify strong correlations in the taste for different products not captured in conventional logit models. Estimates of the supply response of cable suggest that without DBS entry cable prices would be about 15 percent higher and cable quality would fall. We find a welfare gain of between $127 and $190 per year (aggregate $2.5 billion) for satellite buyers, and about $50 (aggregate $3 billion) for cable subscribers.','* The results indicate that the own-price elasticity of expanded basic is at about -1.5 while the demands for premium cable and DBS are substantially more elastic (-3.2 and -2.4). The cross-price elasticities suggest that DBS and premium are the closest substitutes. \n\n* The supply side results exploit the estimated controls from the structural demand side model and suggest that more competition from DBS is correlated with lower cable prices and somewhat higher quality cable. \n\n* Overall there is a significant welfare gain to the 16 million satellite buyers between $2-3 billion, depending upon whether changes in cable prices and characteristics are added back into the calculation.

Contrary to conventional wisdom, we find that lowering the cost of sampling music will propel more consumers to purchase music online as the total cost of evaluation and acquisition decreases. Attempts to prevent sampling will be counterproductive in the long run. Sharing technologies erode the superstar phenomenon widely prevalent in the music business. Extensive empirical investigations, based on surveys and Billboard ranking charts, lend support to the economic model and validate the key results.','The main results of this study are:\n\n*Decreasing sampling costs not only lead more potential consumers to sample unknown music items but also lead more consumers to buy the music items that they have sampled.\n\n* Lower sampling costs have a positive effect on the consumer surplus of samplers, which, in turn, has a positive effect on their purchasing intentions.\n\n* The industry can potentially reverse the effects of online audio piracy by providing more legal and efficient sampling techniques that consumers could use. This is contrary to the anecdotal belief that online availability of digital music leads only to a drain on profitability.\n\n* The impact of music availability online has a differential impact based on the realized value of the music to the consumers. For higher valued songs, online search and sampling capabilities have a beneficial impact on sales. Lower valued music items are pirated more than higher valued items, ceteris paribus, and consequently sales of those suffer. \n\n* Superstars come under increasing threat from two fronts: (a) a greater proportion of sampling of superstar music leads to piracy—users who sample do so with an increased intention to pirate, and (b) decreasing sampling costs lead to an erosion of superstardom. However, there is a greater probability of discovering other high quality music items by lesser known artists with the new technology, which will hurt a superstar’s sales—and, hence, status.','\"Online music technologies are fundamentally altering the landscape of the music business.

This article presents a three-part test for fair use that reflects this focus on market failure, and traces how this test could be incorporated within the traditional approach to fair use. Moreover, the discussion of the Williams & Wilkins opinion, which most closely applies the three-part test, and of the Betamax case, demonstrated that the test can provide a framework in which the courts can directly face the underlying issues that should govern the application of fair use doctrine to new technologies.','* Where (1) defendant could not appropriately purchase the desired use through the market; (2) transferring control over the use to defendant would serve the public interest; and (3) the copyright owner\'s incentives would not be substantially impaired by allowing the user to proceed, courts have in the past considered, and should in the future consider, defendant\'s use \"fair.\" While other approaches to fair use may legitimately be advanced, much of fair use depends on the resolution of these concerns.\n\n* Contrary to the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit\'s view in Universal City Studios, Inc. v. Sony Corp. of America (Betamax) 659 F.2d 963 (9th Cir.1981), the \"productive\" status of a user is at best merely a secondary indicator that these concerns may be satisfied. \n\n* The courts and Congress have employed fair use to permit uncompensated transfers that are socially desirable but not capable of effectuation through the market.\n\n* It is important that a market failure approach to fair use not be expanded into a justification for allowing court intervention whenever the market fails to reach \"perfect\" results, for no market is ever perfect. What emerges from the case law and the copyright statute is a focus on individual types of transactions, not a concern with restructuring an entire set of markets to reach ideal goals, and an identification of those imperfections that will not be tolerated because of their particular impact on dissemination and the ultimate goals of copyright. That transactional emphasis is the proper one. It allows particularly desirable transfers that are blocked by market failure to go forward outside the market, but also allows the courts to impose liability where widespread use of this bypass would cause substantial injury to the copyright owner.','* The market approach will provide a guide both to ascertaining where the public interest might lie in a given case, and to identifying those occasions on which a court may appropriately substitute its evaluation of the public interest for its usual refusal to second-guess the copyright owner. \n\n* A market approach can serve as a means for applying fair use to newly emerging uses of copyrighted works made possible by developing technologies\n\n* By unifying the various traditional fair use factors into one economic model, the article aims to serve as an aid to predicting fair use results and as a guide to future development of the doctrine.','http://www.detritus.net/rhizome/legal/Gordon-Fair_Use.html','http://www.detritus.net/rhizome/legal/Gordon-Fair_Use.html',0,0,0,'The authors unifies the fair use factors into one economic model by analysing two seminal rulings.'),('Gowers_(2006)','Gowers (2006)','http://www.copyrightevidence.org/evidence-wiki/index.php/Gowers_(2006)',2006,'Gowers Review of Intellectual Property','For many citizens, Intellectual Property (IP) is an obscure and distant domain – its laws shrouded in jargon and technical mystery, its applications relevant only to a specialist audience. And yet IP is everywhere. Even a simple coffee jar relies on a range of IP rights – from patents to copyright, designs to trade marks.\n\nIn the modern world, knowledge capital, more than physical capital, drives the UK economy. Against the backdrop of the increasing importance of ideas, IP rights, which protect their value, are more vital than ever. The ideal IP system creates incentives for innovation, without unduly limiting access for consumers and follow on innovators. It must strike the right balance in a rapidly changing world so that innovators can see further by standing on the shoulders of giants.\n\nThe Government’s decision to commission this Review was an explicit recognition both of the growing importance of IP and of the challenges brought by the changing economic environment. In commissioning the Review, the Chancellor and the Secretaries of State for Trade and Industry, and Culture, Media and Sport asked me to establish whether the system was fit for purpose in an era of globalisation, digitisation and increasing economic specialisation.\n\nThe answer is a qualified ‘yes’. I do not think the system is in need of radical overhaul. However, taking a holistic view of the system, I believe there is scope for reform to serve better the interests of consumers and industry alike. There are three areas in which the Review concentrates its recommendations to improve the UK framework for innovation:\n\n• strengthening enforcement of IP rights, whether through clamping down on piracy or trade in\ncounterfeit goods;\n• reducing costs of registering and litigating IP rights for businesses large and small; and\n• improving the balance and flexibility of IP rights to allow individuals, businesses and institutions to use\ncontent in ways consistent with the digital age.\n\nMuch IP policy is framed by European, and indeed global, treaties and agreements. I recognise that not all the recommendations are within the direct purview of the UK Government. However, I have not shied away from making recommendations with European or broader international import when they seemed necessary. Indeed, with the European Commission currently reviewing both the copyright acquis and the question of a Community patent, this is a timely point at which to put forward the Review’s arguments. \n\nI would like to express my thanks to all those who assisted me in producing this Review. Many individuals and organisations gave generously of their time to contribute insights, and in particular the great diversity and depth of responses to the Call for Evidence were invaluable. I owe a special debt to the Review team, who have supported me throughout: Richard Sargeant, Steve Coles, Alastair Cowie, Suzy Kantor, Nicola Kay, Stephen Rowan and Nathan Sansom.\n\nI hope this Review provides sound recommendations on how the IP regime should respond to the challenges that it faces. Getting the balance right is vital to driving innovation, securing investment and stimulating competition. Lasting success will belong to those who get this right.','\"The Review found the current system to be broadly performing satisfactorily. However, there are a number of areas where reform is necessary to improve the system for all its users. The Review therefore sets out a range of pragmatic recommendations, which can be grouped around three themes: first, stronger enforcement of rights; second, lower costs for business; and finally, balanced and flexible rights.\"\n\nFrom these conclusions the review makes a considerable number of policy recommendations which can be found below.','The review states the following about instruments of Intellectual Property (IP); patents, copyright, trade marks and designs.\n\n• balance; the instruments should ensure that the incentive to innovate is balanced against the ability of follow-on innovators to access knowledge.\n\n• coherence; the instruments should be clear and consistent; the scope of rights should not change retrospectively in order to ensure trust in the system; and the international system should promote innovation in all countries.\n\n• flexibility; the instruments should be flexible in order to respond to the changing economic environment and the needs of rights holders and users.\n\nThe Review has made a number of recommendations to improve the framework for innovation; in particular it has called for:\n\n• stronger enforcement of IP rights to ensure practical protection is provided for rights owners and effective deterrents to infringement are in place.\n\n• lower operational costs for business, simplifying processes such as licensing and litigation, and improving education and advice.\n\n• greater balance and flexibility of IP rights to allow individuals, businesses and institutions to use information and ideas in ways consistent with the digital age.\n\nSpecific to copyright the review made the following key recommendations:\n\n* Enable educational provisions to cover distance learning and interactive whiteboards by 2008 by amending sections 35 and 36 of the Copyright, Designs and Patents Act, 1988 (CDPA).\n\n* The European Commission should retain the length of protection on sound recordings and performers’ rights at 50 years.\n\n*Policy makers should adopt the principle that the term and scope of protection for IP rights should not be altered retrospectively.\n\n* Introduce a limited private copying exception by 2008 for format shifting for works published after the date that the law comes into effect. There should be no accompanying levies for consumers.\n\n* Allow private copying for research to cover all forms of content. This relates to the copying, not the distribution, of media.\n\n* Amend s.42 of the CDPA by 2008 to permit libraries to copy the master copy of all classes of work in permanent collection for archival purposes and to allow further copies to be made from the archived copy to mitigate against subsequent wear and tear.\n\n* Enable libraries to format shift archival copies by 2008 to ensure records do not become obsolete.\n\n* Propose that Directive 2001/29/EC be amended to allow for an exception for creative, transformative or derivative works, within the parameters of the Berne Three Step Test.\n\n* Create an exception to copyright for the purpose of caricature, parody or pastiche by 2008. \n\n* Propose a provision for orphan works to the European Commission, amending Directive 2001/29/EC.\n\n* The Patent Office should issue clear guidance on the parameters of a ‘reasonable search’ for orphan works, in consultation with rights holders, collecting societies, rights owners and archives, when an orphan works exception comes into being.\n\n* The Patent Office should establish a voluntary register of copyright; either on its own, or through partnerships with database holders, by 2008.\n\n* Match penalties for online and physical copyright infringement by amending section 107 of the CDPA by 2008.\n\n* Monitor success of current measures to combat unfair competition in cases relating to IP, and if changes are found to be ineffective, Government should consult on appropriate changes.\n\n* DCA should review the issues raised in its forthcoming consultation paper on damages and seek further evidence to ensure that an effective and dissuasive system of damages exists for civil IP cases and that it is operating effectively. It should bring forward any proposals for change by the end of 2007.\n\n* Observe the industry agreement of protocols for sharing data between ISPs and rights holders to remove and disbar users engaged in ‘piracy’. If this has not proved operationally successful by the end of 2007, Government should consider whether to legislate.\n\n* The Home Office should recognise IP crime as an area for Police action as a component of organised crime within the updated National Community Safety Plan.\n\n* Give Trading Standards the power to enforce copyright infringement by enacting section 107A of the Copyright, Designs and Patents Act 1988 by 2007.\n\n* Strengthen Practice Directions, to provide greater encouragement for parties to mediate, in particular this should raise the profile of mediation with judges.\n\n* The Patent Office should consult with the Judicial Studies Board to determine the extent to which the complexity of IP law may give rise to a training need for judges and magistrates and their legal advisers.\n\n* Support the establishment of a single EU court to adjudicate cross-border IP disputes by promoting the European Patent Litigation Agreement. \n\n* Establish a new Strategic Advisory Board for IP policy (SABIP), covering the full range of IP rights, reporting to the minister responsible, by 2007.

An experimental investigation on the effect of charitable donations on piracy','Producers in the recording industry frequently market products for which a part of the proceeds goes to charitable causes. We investigate whether a corporate pledge to donate a portion of profits to a charitable cause will decrease the extent to which customers illegally obtain that company\'s products. Donations to charitable causes may increase the moral intensity of piracy (robbing the poor rather than robbing the rich) and consequently may reduce the willingness to pirate. This rationale is empirically tested through a dual empirical strategy, that is, a market survey and a laboratory experiment. We show that market piracy decreases when a very low or very high donation mechanism is implemented. Nevertheless, for intermediate levels of transfer, piracy increases again.','Main results of the study:\n\n*The hypothesis \"Donation to social causes reduces piracy\" is confirmed since the level of piracy is lower when a donation mechanism is present \n\n*Consequently, the number of real exchanges is higher in the experimental session in which a donation mechanism is implemented. When no donation mechanism is implemented, the number of exchanges is the lowest, the rate of piracy (measured by the non-respect of the official exchange rate) is the highest, the stated and effective exchange rate are the lowest, and, the level of ethical dissonance is the lowest.\n\n*In sum, donation does not reduce piracy for intermediate levels of transfer, which partly supports hypothesis \"The higher the donation level, the lower the piracy rate.\"\n\n*This result is consistent with the market survey, in which some individuals argued that profit-oriented firms are unlikely to devote intermediate or high percentages of proceeds to charitable causes. The relationship between donations (as a percentage of proceeds) and the level of piracy seems to follow a roughly U-shaped curve. \n\n*This result can be intuitively interpreted in terms of piracy elasticity. Piracy elasticity for a given product measures the responsiveness of piracy of this product to a given change in the amount of donations, which can be expressed as the percentage of the proceeds devoted to a social cause.','Policy implications:\n\n*Donations to charitable causes can be “instrumentalized” by pirated firms or may simply constitute a byproduct of other motivations such as improving the company’s image or altruistic behavior. In the latter, the reduction in piracy can be considered as an unintended effect. \n\n*The percentage of proceeds devoted to the social cause and the characteristics of the social cause are likely to influence the extent to which pirates modify their behavior.\n\n*Without neglecting capitalistic (e.g., technological devices preventing fraudulent copies) and regulatory alternatives (e.g., monitoring investments, lobbying for severe sanctions against pirates), taking into account psychological and moral factors may lead managers to increase “moral barriers” for pirates and/or to align pirates’ moral incentives with the firm’s interests. The strategic use of charitable  causes to increase the moral intensity of piracy requires comprehensive knowledge of pirates and of their perceptions of different causes.','http://prodinra.inra.fr/?locale=en#!ConsultNotice:23335','http://www.sciencedirect.com.ezproxy.lib.gla.ac.uk/science/article/pii/S1053535708000164',0,0,0,'In April 2006, a market survey was conducted with a representative sample of 168 people in the metropolitan areaof Dijon, France.

Its purpose is to consider how Member States have implemented the Directive into national law and to assist the Commission in evaluating whether the Directive, as currently formulated, remains the appropriate response to the continuing challenges faced by the stakeholders concerned, such as rights holders, commercial users, consumers, educational and scientific users. As set out in specifications of the study set out by the Commission, its aim is \'to assess the role that the Directive has played in fostering the digital market for goods and services in the four years since its adoption\'. The impact of the Directive on the development of digital (chiefly online) business models, therefore, will be the focal point of our enquiry throughout this study.','*The exclusive rights laid down in the Directive have indeed contributed to increased confidence in emerging digital markets and online business models. This conclusion however was to be mitigated by the fact that many of these rights already existed prior to the Directive, albeit not in a harmonized European framework. \n*The right of making available has undoubtedly resulted in a large-scale redrafting of contracts to adapt to online markets. However, applying the terms of the Directive does not always lead to clear-cut results. To cite one example, it remains unclear and entails practical problems whether streaming is to fall under the right of making available or if it is to be counted under broadcasting rights.\n*The codification of a broad right of reproduction that includes temporary copying is widely perceived as having created obstacles to budding online business models. This stems from the fact that it has created an overlap with the right of communication to the public, which adds complexity to the licensing process and sometimes a need for ‘double’ licenses from concurrent rightholders or collecting societies. Indeed, it could be said that this aspect of the Directive has raised transaction costs. It was therefore suggested to further restrict the right of reproduction to the realm of physical copies.\n*The need to simplify cross-border licensing which is still tributary to national laws was also broached. One way to deal with this was to promote Community-wide licensing, as was being attempted by the Commission’s Recommendation. Another, more fundamental approach would be to truly unify copyright norms by establishing a unified European copyright regime.\n*A clear need for a higher degree of harmonisation was certainly felt in the area of limitations. Most participants seemed to favour the introduction of a list of mandatory exceptions, possibly including certain non-overridable limitations. However, because many such exceptions are informed by cultural considerations, not everyone agreed such a mandatory list is desirable. Those who favoured a rapprochement with the American ‘fair use’ concept were countered with the argument that its flexibility could undermine legal certainty. It was agreed that consumer interests which are also reflected in certain exceptions to copyright should be dealt with primarily in the framework of consumer law.\n*The application of TPMs, in turn, has likely fostered the emergence of online business models as investment in online subscription services has apparently increased. However, many doubt the necessity of adding an additional legal layer of protection through anti-circumvention rules.','DRM must be made more transparent in the interest of both emerging business models and consumers. In this context, the need to protect consumers’ privacy was underscored. Finally, a dangerous tendency was observed to use TPMs to protect business models rather than content. It was agreed this perverted the purpose of the Directive which is to protect TPMs to benefit of rightholders. A standardisation of TPMs could help to avoid such abuses. Legal solutions to this problem, however, are best found in consumer law and competition law rather than copyright law.','http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2006358','http://ec.europa.eu/internal_market/copyright/docs/studies/infosoc-study_en.pdf',1,0,1,'This methodology has an empirical and an analytical component that might help predicting the Directive’s impact on the behaviour of market players.

Despite this rising interest in the crime, only a few empirical studies of digital piracy have been conducted from a criminological perspective. Though they form an important foundation for research in this area, there are weaknesses in the design of these previous studies. Specifically, prior studies have used convenience samples, been cross-sectional, used weak question wording or questionable scenarios, failed to distinguish between online and offline piracy, and used linear regression estimations.

In terms of consumer welfare, consumers who pirate software may stand in opposition to those who purchase it. Marketers also face a decision whether to attempt to thwart that piracy or to ignore, if not encourage it as an aid to their software\'s diffusion, and policymakers face the decision whether to adopt interventionist policies, which are government-centric, or laissez faire policies, which are marketer-centric. Here in order to assess the decision-making of all three of these stakeholders, we focus on the consumer\'s point-of-view as central and examine it by considering on a comparative basis the ethical dimension versus other dimensions, including economic,legal, and other salient consumer behavior considerations. Based on a survey of 689 software consumers conducted over the Internet, the results indicate that ethics as a factor is embedded in a multidimensional set of determinant factors influencing software piracy, including attitudes, legal aspects, social support,perceptions of economic loss and age. Policy and research implications, based on these findings, are provided.','*As indicated by ATTITUDE, ethics is clearly an important variable in consumers\' orientations to software piracy. Consumers who are less concerned with ethics are more likely to pirate than others. \n\n*Ethics and legal aspects may be conflated or combined by consumers as indicated in the ATTITUDE variable. \n\n*Another important finding concerns social support for piracy (SOCIAL). In this regard, softiifting is not a mere individual action, but takes place in a technologically oriented community ecosystem in which piracy for many is a tolerated, if not an ethically or socially prescribed, consumer and business tool.','Software piracy as an acquisition-mode issue is not only a major concern for marketers marketer-centric), but also is a complex policy issue (government-centric) in which the benefits of punitive policies must be weighed against the effects of more liberalized ones.\nSuch policies should be evaluated in terms of consumer ethics, attitudes and behavior, supply conditions, and the strategies employed to insure optimal profits.

They have revolutionized the information landscape. \nLibraries and archives support the work of scientists and scholars, which is increasingly collaborative, interdisciplinary and global in nature. In tandem with the expanding opportunities for search and resource discovery enabled by digital technologies, there is growing demand to access materials held in libraries and archives around the world. Global library spending on print and digital content runs into billions of dollars every year – much of it taxpayer funded. In 2014 this amounted to an estimated USD25.4 billion. But faced with a maze of different copyright laws and licensing conditions, libraries and archives are finding it increasingly difficult to respond to the information needs of the public they serve. \nPreserving our documentary heritage, “our memory of the world,” is expensive.  To lower these costs, reduce duplication of effort and maximize reach, libraries and archives are exploring ways of using digital technologies to create shared preservation infrastructures both nationally and internationally. This is imperative within the borderless digital arena. As noted by European Commission Vice-President Andrus Ansip, responsible for the Digital Single Market, “the borderless nature of digital technologies means it no longer makes sense for each EU country to have its own rules for telecommunications services, copyright, data protection, or the management of radio spectrum.”','*The WIPO study reveals that the majority of member states of the World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO) – 156 of the 188 countries surveyed (83 percent of them) – have at least one statutory library exception. 32 countries (17 percent) of those surveyed still have no provision for libraries or archives within their domestic copyright law.\n\n*Nearly half of WIPO’s member states – 90 of them (48 percent of the total) – do not explicitly allow libraries to make copies for research or study. The situation is even worse for archives, with two-thirds – 126 countries or 67 percent of them – not permitting archives to make copies for research or study purposes. Moreover, 89 countries (47 percent of the total surveyed) do not  explicitly allow libraries to make copies for preservation purposes; and 85 of them (45 percent of the total) do not allow archives to make such copies. \n\n*In countries where new anti-circumvention protections (technologies designed to restrict unauthorized access to protected works) have been introduced, while 52 countries have exempted libraries, around half of them have not. In practice, this means that where a technological protection measure is applied to digital content, libraries cannot circumvent it even to make use of an exception under copyright law, and therefore cannot copy the work concerned. In effect, the law is giving with one hand, and taking away with the other. \n\n*Data obtained from the British Library under a Freedom of Information request show that the number of journal titles available under the INCD service fell by 93 percent, from 330,700 titles in 2011 to 23,600 in 2012. More titles “disappeared” than are available under the non-commercial licenses, and some 28,300 titles are no longer available either at commercial or non-commercial rates. \n\n* In 2011, the Library provided information to libraries in 59 countries under the copyright-based service. By 2014 under the licensed service, the number of countries served had fallen to 33. The reduction in journal titles available to non-commercial users appears to be linked to the fact that the majority of titles are now only available at commercial rates.\n\n*The number of requests the British Library was able to satisfy under its new scheme, in the first year of its service, fell by 92 percent, from 38,100 to 2,884. Whereas in 2011 the Library would have anticipated fulfilling over 100,000 requests for information during the period 2012-2104, by the end of 2014 the number had fallen to just 1,057, representing a year-onyear reduction of 97 percent. While the Library still has the documents, in many cases it is no longer able to provide them under the new licensing arrangement. In fact, in 2012 more requests for information were refused due to licensing restrictions (2,942) than were satisfied under the new licensing service (2,884).','A new  international agreement would create a common global understanding that protects access to information as a public good through libraries and archives for the  benefit of education, innovation and development.

During this process, a community of fellow users is of major importance for the entrepreneur, serving as a knowledge pool for skills development and experimentation with different commercialization paths. We study a nascent group of firms founded by users of video games who became entrepreneurs on entering the animation industry by producing Machinima, a new film genre characterized by shooting film in video games. We explain how user entrepreneurs gain access to complementary assets (video games) for their new use (shooting film), how they deal with intellectual property issues when using other firms’ assets, and how user entrepreneurs combine domain knowledge about film production with their experience in video games and the art of Machinima. Our propositions hold implications for management and policy.','- There is a potential relevance of assets for user entrepreneurs’ entry into commercial marketplaces, while there is also a nascent group of firms that contribute to developing a new genre in the industry they enter, which underscores the novelty of their products and the associated risks of IP infringement.\n\n- Selective sharing may apply to different types of asset (game engine, artwork, toolkits, etc.), which in turn represent different trade-offs for the user entrepreneur in terms of gaining access to, or substituting for, the asset; however, commercialising with others’ assets in a new industry remains an understudied area.\n\n- User innovation occurs in communities, where individual domain knowledge is brought to avoid technical problems, share solutions, promote work, and develop or improve technology.\n\n- Entrepreneurs\' domain knowledge relevant to commercialisation plays a key role in bringing innovations to industry as products.','- Two-stage entry (first under the radar of incumbent firms and then commercialisation) into the animation industry can be helpful in avoiding: i) apparent conflict over IP rights by first relying on informal copyright practices, and ii) large investments in established distribution channels by using the Internet.\n\n- User innovation rests on the advantage provided by sticky knowledge and users’ local perception of their own and their community’s needs, while user entrepreneurs effectively leverage community knowledge for entry into new industries.\n\n- Users diffuse technologies across industry boundaries depending on their assessment of the components of the technology, on their own costs of re-creating it, and on the outcome of the negotiations with the owners of the IP rights to the technology, which may in turn be a question of timing.\n\n- While the user community of Machinimators was instrumental in diffusing knowledge about the application of video games to animation production, process and business knowledge (sequel and storyline development, distribution channels) were revealed to a far lesser extent, which is consistent with both the atomistic versus collective user entrepreneurship and the logic of selective revealing.','http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0048733310001563',NULL,0,0,0,''),('Hagedoorn_and_Ridder_(2012)','Hagedoorn and Ridder (2012)','http://www.copyrightevidence.org/evidence-wiki/index.php/Hagedoorn_and_Ridder_(2012)',2012,'Open innovation, contracts, and intellectual property rights: an exploratory empirical study','Our exploratory empirical study, based on a series of in-depth interviews and a survey of firms, searches for answers on a number of questions that deal with the role of formal contracts and intellectual property rights in the context of open innovation. We find that firms active in open innovation have a strong preference for the governance of their open innovation relationships through formal contracts. These contracts are relevant from both a control and a process monitoring perspective. Also, despite the open nature of open innovation, firms still see intellectual property rights as highly relevant to the protection of their innovative capabilities. In a first attempt to explain this preference for intellectual property rights by open innovation firms, we find the degree of openness of firms, their legalistic attitude, and the competitive dynamics of their product market environment to be related to this preference.','*Our findings show that firms active in open innovation see both the legal (control) perspective and the practical (monitoring) perspective as quite relevant. On average, firms in our sample perceive contracts as an important legal mechanism to control their collaboration with open innovation partners, as indicated by an average score of 5.42 on a 7 point Likert scale. The perceived importance of formal contracts as a means to monitor the progress of collaboration is somewhat lower with an average score of 5.10 on a 7 point Likert scale. These different scores for the use of contracts for control or monitoring purposes turned out to be only marginally statistically significant.\n\n*Firms active in open innovation seem to have a very strong preference for (renewable) contracts to govern their relationship with their partners when they engage in joint R&D, joint product and process development, and joint design. Not using contracts is 15 very much rather the exception than the rule. Also, open innovation firms value these contracts from both a legal control perspective as well as a more practical process monitoring perspective. \n\n* These firms indicate that, without IPR, they would be less inclined to cooperate with other firms as, based on their IPR protection, they are willing to invest in innovative activities that they can share with others.  Results from our survey show a more detailed perspective on the role of IPR. It turns out that patents and technical and commercial information (trade secrets) are seen as the most important instruments to protect the innovative capabilities of firms from their open innovation partners, as indicated by nearly 90% of the firms in our sample. Trademarks and design rights are also seen as relevant by a substantial share of firms (nearly 75% and over 65%, respectively). Given the industry breakdown of the firms in our sample, it is probably not surprising that a smaller share of firms (about 53%) see the relevance of copyrights for the protection of their innovative capabilities.','*The research indicates that in terms of the governance of their collaborative innovative \nactivities, firms active in open innovation appear to follow a somewhat ‘unadventurous’ \nstrategy.

I test if this holds empirically in the music industry using data from an exclusive file-sharing website that allows users to share music files using the BitTorrent protocol. These are the most reliable file-sharing data available because they are from a private tracker, which is an invitation-only file-sharing network. \n\nTo overcome the endogeneity of the number of downloads, I exploit variation in the availability of sound recordings in file-sharing networks to isolate the causal effect of file-sharing on music sales. The results strongly suggest that the aggregate effect of file-sharing is precisely estimated to be extremely small. The direction of the effect is positive but its magnitude indicates that file-sharing does not increase or decrease aggregate sales in the music industry. I conclude with an investigation of the distributional effects of file-sharing on sales and find that file-sharing benefits more established and popular artists at the expense of newer and smaller artists. These results are consistent with recent trends in the music industry.','The main results of this study are:\n\n* File sharing does not increase or decrease sales in the music industry but that this aggregate impact masks important distributional effects. \n\n* The results suggest that established/popular artists benefit from file sharing, while new/small artists do not. In particular, file sharing redistributes sales toward artists in the pop genre and away from artists in niche genres such as indie music. \n\n* The effects of file sharing are meaningfully positive for artists who have had an album sell at least 100,000 units but not for artists who have not. Likewise, the effects are meaningfully positive for artists who have released more than three albums but not for newer artists.\n\n* These distributional effects are likely to have important consequences for the ability of the music industry to continue to produce sound recordings that cater to a large variety of tastes among heterogeneous music consumers.','While the study focuses on the short-run consequences of file sharing on sales and the distribution of sales between new/small artists and established/popular artists, the author highlights the importance of investigating long-run effects. To understand how a shift toward more established artists will affect the trajectory of the music industry, one must conjecture how major and independent labels will respond to the increasingly top-heavy landscape that is predicted by these findings.

Despite a substantial literature on the effects of piracy on demand for recorded music, information on the supply effects of digital copying is limited. This paper presents empirical evidence that digital copying has not reduced the supply of new, copyrighted sound recordings in Germany. Even with a strong reduction in sales of sound recordings that accompanied the diffusion of digital copying technology, the annual number of new titles released to the market continued to expand. Results indicate that the number of new titles released has not deviated significantly from a long-term upward trend. The paper also presents evidence that the amount of time listening to sound recordings has not fallen over this period, suggesting no strong decline in the quality of new work.','* The analysis found no significant impact of digital copying and severe sales declines between 1999 and 2006 on the number of new titles supplied in the German market for sound recordings. \n* Eight years into the recession, the number of new titles supplied continued to expand.

Casting the net more widely than previous surveys, it highlights noteworthy gaps and contradictions in the literature. There is initial evidence, for example, that the economic effects of digital copying vary between different industries, but these differences are not yet well understood. Most importantly, the empirical literature is unbalanced. The bulk of econometric research has focused on unauthorized copying and rights holder revenues. Little is known about the implications for user welfare, for the supply of copyright works, or about the costs of running a copyright system — and the preliminary evidence is often quite surprising. Much work on these issues remains to arrive at reasonable implications for copyright policy.','This paper advances a relatively elaborate taxonomy of empirical studies on the economic consequences of unauthorized copying and copyright. The classification and overview presented here yields an important insight: the empirical literature is unbalanced. The bulk of econometric research has focused on rights holders, and in particular on the extent to which unauthorized copying harms rights holders. In order to inform copyright policy, it will also be necessary to make progress on several other topics. Little is known about the implications in real markets for user welfare, for the supply of copyright works, or about the costs of running a copyright system.','Many studies on unauthorized copying and rights holder revenues find a significant negative effect, at least over the relatively short periods of time covered in most assessments. If this stands, other steps have to follow in order to inform copyright policy. It is still unclear how user welfare is affected, and what the more protracted effects are, for instance on the supply\nof copyright works. The sparse evidence so far raises doubts whether any losses to rights holders translate into a loss in social welfare under current market conditions. For example, there is hardly any evidence that copyright strength would be positively related to the quantity or quality of copyright works supplied. Particularly in this area, much work remains to arrive at\nreasonable implications for copyright policy.','http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2101084','http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2101084',0,0,0,'This study is a literature review and has no original data.'),('Handke_(2015)','Handke (2015)','http://www.copyrightevidence.org/evidence-wiki/index.php/Handke_(2015)',2015,'Digitization and Competition in Copyright Industries: One Step Forward and Two Steps Back?','How can copyright promote innovation in digital markets? Based on economic reasoning and empirical evidence, this paper provides an original perspective on this question. It focuses on two aspects of digitization – unauthorized copying and digital retailing – and how they affect two determinants of innovation – competition and appropriability in copyright industries. Unauthorized copying has ambiguous consequences: on the one hand, it affects the extent to which suppliers of reproducible creative works can appropriate the value of these intangible goods; on the other hand, unauthorized copying has increased competition between suppliers of creative works, and is associated with substantial productivity increases. Contrary to common expectations, our empirical evidence suggests that digital retailing is not associated with disintermediation and has not made the market for recorded music more contestable. Furthermore, the market power of Internet-based intermediaries can undermine the appropriability of creators, which has not yet been acknowledged in debates on copyright reforms. In this context, copyright policy that focuses on controlling unauthorized use can be ineffective. It needs to be complemented by regulation that limits the market power of digital retailers.','*In Germany, digital retailing has expanded rapidly since the formation of the iTunes store in 2004 – see table 1. Digital unit sales were negligible before and increased from up 7.9 million in 2004 to 61.6 million in 2009, when they made up more than a third of the market for authorized copies of sound recordings. By 2012, the majority of unit sales were ‘digital’. Furthermore, income from subscription services and advertising-financed music streaming services online have been growing rapidly (not covered in Table 1). To be sure, in terms of retail value, the share of the digital market is lower, since average retail prices per unit in the digital market are lower. Nevertheless, it is clear that large parts of the legitimate market for recorded music has become ‘digital’ since 2004.\n\n*The most relevant observation for this paper is that growth in the number of record companies was relatively high before the popularization of digital retailing. The number of record companies expanded less rapidly in the period in which digital sales started to pick up. In the five years from 1999 to 2003, when authorized digital retailing had been negligible, the number of firms had expanded by an average of 68 firms per year. After the iTunes store had 18 started operating in 2004, digital retailing proliferated. From 2005 to 2009, the number of record companies increased on average by less than 12 firms per year, and by less than 21 firms per year for the entire period from 2005 to 2013. This is a striking difference from the years preceding digital retailing, especially because accumulated revenues from sales of sound recordings in Germany fell much more rapidly from 1999 to 2003 (physical and digital). Nominal revenues fell by over 34% in the five years before substantial digital retailing from 1999 and 2003 (BV Phono 2008). It fell by 12.5% in the five years after 2004, from 2005 to 2009, and by 16.9% in the nine years from 2005 to 2013 (BV Phono 2014). Of course, in a context of broader and disruptive technological change, other factors may be driving these developments. Nevertheless, the number of record companies increased more rapidly before digital retailing started taking up. It is thus improbable that digital retailing would have promoted market entry by record companies.','*Unauthorized digital copying does not only affect the appropriability for creators and rights holders. The empirical literature also indicates that digital copying has increased competition between suppliers of content, and the record industry has become more productive over recent years: while revenues have fallen considerably, the empirical literature to date suggests that the supply of new creative works has continued to increase rapidly (Waldfogel 2011, 2012; Handke 2012a). Digital retailing may co-determine this development, as it makes trading of copyright works more efficient. However, according to the evidence presented in this paper, digital retailing does not promote the position of newcomers and fringe suppliers, and is thus unlikely to promote competition between firms supplying copyright works. \n\n*The appropriability of copyright works does not only depend on end-user behaviour. It also depends on the bargaining position of rights holders with (other) intermediaries. The current understanding of markets for information services suggests that digital retailers are likely to acquire a dominant position in markets for copyright works. This paper presents preliminary empirical evidence of such a development. Market power of digital retailers is bound to undermine the prospects of creators and rights holders to appropriate much of the value of the works they supply.\n\n*In a context of digitization, it is not adequate for copyright policy to concentrate on control over the use of copyright works. In the economic perspective, copyright is a costly means to promote pecuniary incentives for content creation. There is little point in establishing exclusive rights over the use information goods if the rights holders are in no position to benefit from it because they face quasi-monopolistic intermediaries.','http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2547403','http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2547403',0,0,0,'The author carries out a study on the digital retailing by analysing the growth of iTunes between 2004 and 2013.'),('Handke_and_Towse_(2007)','Handke and Towse (2007)','http://www.copyrightevidence.org/evidence-wiki/index.php/Handke_and_Towse_(2007)',2007,'Economics of Copyright Collecting Societies','Economists have long recognised that copyright collecting societies (CCS), i.e. organisations that specialise on administering \"copyrights held by a large number of owners\", play a fundamental role in the copyright system. Indeed, the economic literature explains why without such organisations, copyright law would be ineffective in some markets for copyrighted works: the majority of authors and users would not be able to grant or obtain permission to use many works of art, literature, music, film and other such works that copyright law protects. In economic terms, CCS enable markets to function for the use of copyright works in situations in which the copyright holder cannot contract directly with the user. But because many markets for copyright works have changed rapidly over recent years, we should ask under which circumstances CCS would continue to play a constructive, maybe even essential, role. It has been argued many times that technical solutions to digital rights management (DRM) will render CCS obsolete as the market for copyrights shifts online and policy-makers such as the European Commission have begun to scrutinise the role played by CCS in the dynamic market for copyrighted media content online (REC 2005/737/EC). The purpose of this survey of the specialised economic literature is to take stock and to identify possible gaps in the understanding of the economics of CCS and to advocate attention to this literature in contemporary debates about them.','* Collecting societies are an efficient way of distributing remittances for copyright to artists by minimising individual transaction costs\n* Collecting societies tend to operate as a monopoly or a bilateral monopoly but despite this the pricing of  content licenses tends to be set at a point chosen by the market\n* Digital Rights Management may be able to take over some of the functions of collecting agencies in the future\n* Various for-profit organisations seek to enter the market of collecting license fees but despite increasing competition this is unlikely to result in fairer pricing','* Collecting societies tend to operate as monopolies; despite this they seem to operate efficiently within the market in terms of minimising transaction costs and setting a fair price point \n* Blanket licensing is common to most collecting societies but is less efficient as it does not take into account the higher price that could be set for more popular content \n* Technological advances may allow Digital Rights Management to take over some of the functions of collecting societies in future  \n* There may be cause for further regulation to incorporate technological advances such as downloading','http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1159085','http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1159085',0,0,0,'This study is a literature review of 40 studies examining the role of copyright collecting societies, including 2 reports from the European Commission.'),('Hanke,_Girard_and_Mattes_(2015)','Handke, Girard and Mattes (2015)','http://www.copyrightevidence.org/evidence-wiki/index.php/Hanke,_Girard_and_Mattes_(2015)',2015,'Copyright and Innovation: Fit for Digitization?','It is contentious to what extent the existing copyright system contributes to the positive development of the regulated sectors of society. The present report shows that substantially more musical works and movies have been released in recent years than before the diffusion of digital copying technology. At the same time, the average quality of these works has been stable according to user assessments. Countries with stronger copyright protection do not exhibit greater supply of new works. Accordingly, the relatively strict copyright protection in some countries does not seem to promote the supply of new creative works. The present report also considers whether user-generated content (UGC) complements or substitutes professional content. An increasing supply of valuable UGC is not reflected in official economic statistics. In all probability, copyright protection promotes user-generated content less than professional content. As a result, substituting professional content with \"amateur material\" could reduce the socially desirable strength of copyright protection. However, we find that almost half of all works available on YouTube are professional content. Professional works are watched and recommended more frequently than the average. In addition, a large proportion of UGC on YouTube draws on professional works. There is little evidence that professional content would be widely replaced. It follows that UGC could also be supported by an efficient copyright system, which strengthens the supply of professional content without excessively limiting its further use as input for UGC.','*Overall, sales between 2001 and 2012 fell by more than 20 percent. According to the IMDb database, the number of new film releases has risen relatively steadily since 2001. At the same time, the average rating of movies released in the relevant year has remained constant\n\n*Revenue from the sale of authorized copies of recorded music to consumers has fallen by more than 50 percent since the early 2000s. In contrast, the supply of new creative works increased almost continuously over the observation period. Average user rating of music recordings from the individual years has remained virtually unchanged throughout the same period. This descriptive analysis indicates no direct negative association between revenues of copyright holders’ and the supply and quality of new works.\n\n*Professional content is the largest group with a share of 46 percent. UGC has a share of 33 percent. On average, professional content was accessed over four times more than UGC. In contrast, the average number of “likes” for professional content and for UGC is similarly high, so the ratio of “likes” to views is greater for UGC. This is perhaps not only due to the quality of the videos but also due to greater motivation to leave positive feedback for amateurs than for professionals. Overall, professional content makes up a considerable share of YouTube material. It would be an exaggeration to claim that professional content is largely being replaced. In addition, a substantial minority of UGC in the broader sense, including the mixed forms, builds directly on the repertoire of commercial works. In the long run, this part of UGC probably depends on an ample supply of new, valuable professional works. UGC is not yet associated with a reduction in supply of professional material. The growing dissemination and consumption of UGC demonstrates that these types of works are of considerable value, adding to professional content.','* Considering the supply of new creative works, it is clear that the development of music and film in recent years has been more positive than the heated debates on the dangers of digital copying would have us believe. Based on the available data, digital copying does appear to have had a negative effect on innovation in terms of content creation. However, a high degree of uncertainty remains. First, data restrictions do not allow us to draw very firm conclusions. Second, it is difficult to distinguish the impact of copyright from the impact of broader technological change with digitization.\n\n*The findings presented here show that commonly voiced assumptions have no solid basis. There is no solid evidence that the diffusion of digital copying technology fundamentally would have damaged the supply of new works. Neither does it appear that UGC will replace professional content, which would call into question the conventional economic justification for copyright.\n\n*Further empirical work is needed to strengthen the evidence­base for copyright policy. The further development of online databases will facilitate research in the foreseeable future. The next important steps include studying specific aspects of the copyright system, such as: (1) the duration of copyright protection; (2) regulations regarding private copying and notices according to civil law; (3) the reasonable level of public investment in law enforcement; (4) the regulation of collecting societies such as the German Society for Musical Performing and Mechanical Reproduction Rights (GEMA); (5) determining reasonable compensation for different forms of distribution; and (6) competition policy with the emergence of highly concentrated online platforms through which creative works are disseminated.','https://www.econstor.eu/handle/10419/109663','https://www.econstor.eu/handle/10419/109663',0,0,0,'Examining 500 YouTube videos, the authors explore to what extent user-generated content is based on professional copyright works.'),('Hansen,_Hashimoto,_Hinze,_Samuelson_and_Urban_(2013)','Hansen, Hashimoto, Hinze, Samuelson and Urban (2013)','http://www.copyrightevidence.org/evidence-wiki/index.php/Hansen,_Hashimoto,_Hinze,_Samuelson_and_Urban_(2013)',2013,'Solving the Orphan Works Problem for the United States','Over the last decade, the problem of orphan works — i.e., copyrighted works whose owners cannot be located by a reasonably diligent search — has come sharply into focus as libraries, archives, and other large repositories of copyrighted works have sought to digitize and make available their collections online. Although this problem is certainly not limited to digital libraries, it has proven especially challenging for these organizations because they hold diverse collections that include millions of books, articles, letters, photographs, home movies, films, and other types of works. Many items come with a complex, unknown, and (often) unknowable history of copyright ownership. Because U.S. copyright law provides for both strong injunctive relief and monetary damages (in the form of statutory damages of up to $150,000 per work infringed), organizations that cannot obtain permission often do not make their collections available at all.\n\nIn October 2012, the U.S. Copyright Office initiated a new study of orphan works and mass digitization, and has indicated that it is a high-priority policy issue for the office. That study, and the work that preceded it, has highlighted the wide array of perspectives about why and how to address the orphan works problem. In this article, we present evidence that the orphan works problem is very real and that it inhibits many socially valuable uses of copyrighted works by libraries, archives, museums and other memory institutions. We then canvass the array of potential solutions, and ultimately conclude that fair use, combined with the Copyright Office’s remedy limitation approach, are better approaches for addressing this problem in the United States than alternatives proposed elsewhere. Finally, we explore future-looking changes, such as the reintroduction of copyright formalities and the development of registries, that would reduce the number of orphan works in the future.','* Across the spectrum of works held, the numbers of suspected orphans is reported to be large:\n** of 548,000 artworks – 20 to 25% are orphaned\n** of 750,000 sound recording (hrs) – 5 to 10% are orphaned\n** of 21,800,000 commercial film (hrs) – 0 to 7% are orphaned\n** of 513,000 archive fil (hrs) – 5 to 35% are orphaned\n** of more than 100,000,000 photo libraries – approximately 0% are orphaned\n** of 28,280,000 archive photos – 5 to 90% are orphaned\n** of 10,400,000 written material – 4 to 30% are orphaned\n** of 38,000,000 mixed collections – 8 to 40% are orphaned\n* There is clear evidence that the orphan works problem stifles libraries and archives’ efforts to effectively use their collections and prevents those organizations from fulfilling their mission of making collections available for research and scholarship.','*  Fair use, combined with the limitations on remedies approach, as proposed by the U.S. Copyright Office, and future looking changes that would reduce the number of orphan works going forward, would provide the U.S. with a workable and cohesive approach to the orphan works problem.','http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2323945',NULL,0,0,0,'The study uses various sources of data for support, including empirical evidence collected by the U.S. Copyright Office, the Berkeley Digital Library Copyright Project, the UK Intellectual Property Office’s Final Impact Assessment on Orphan Works, the Report on Orphan Works Challenges for Libraries, Archives and Other Memory Institutions, and the Hargreaves Review.'),('Hansen,_Hinze,_and_Urban_(2013)','Hansen, Hinze, and Urban (2013)','http://www.copyrightevidence.org/evidence-wiki/index.php/Hansen,_Hinze,_and_Urban_(2013)',2013,'Orphan Works and the Search for Rightsholders: Who Participates in a \'Diligent Search\' under Present and Proposed Regimes?','Over the past several years, policy makers and private actors have developed an evolving set of approaches for addressing the orphan works problem — a problem that arises when “the owner of a copyrighted work cannot be identified and located by someone who wishes to make use of the work in a manner that requires permission of the copyright owner,” preventing follow-on uses of works. These approaches usually attempt to address the orphan works problem by employing some threshold mechanism to differentiate true orphan works, to which the proposed solutions would apply, from non-orphaned copyrighted works. Satisfying a “reasonably diligent search” is one well-known formulation by which users can designate works as orphaned and therefore subject to a proposed solution, though — as this paper points out — alternative approaches certainly exist. Regardless of the specific formulation, the search for rightsholders (or conversely, the confirmation that no rightsholder can be located) is an integral component of almost every orphan works proposal. This paper examines in detail the core schemes for identifying rightsholders among the leading orphan works regimes and proposals. Although these schemes differ across many variables, three factors predominate: (1) who is expected to participate in the search process, (2) the nature and extent of the required search generally; and (3) specifically what types of resources, tools, registries or other information-sharing mechanisms are required or allowed. This paper compares existing proposals’ approaches with respect to the first factor: who participates in a search? A subsequent paper will focus on the second and third factors.','* Some systems, such as that proposed by the U.S. Copyright Office’s 2006 Report on Orphan Works and the ensuing legislative proposals, are relatively simple in that searches are conducted by independent users acting on their own.\n\n*  Others, such as the system currently in place in Canada and elsewhere, involve more government oversight and an approval process for the use of orphan works.\n\n* Still others remain relatively unclear with respect to what parties would be involved in the search or what level of oversight, if any, would be required to ensure that adequate searches are undertaken.','* Extended Collective Licensing regimes (ECLs) have recently been proposed as a potential orphan works solution. But as this paper points out, there are several unknowns as to how searches by Collective Management Organisations (CMOs) would be conducted, how orphan status would be accounted for in the pricing of licenses, and what sort of oversight would be required to quell conflict of interest concerns. \n\n* More research is needed to understand the relative costs and benefits of allocating search responsibility to different parties, such as the end user or a CMO. This research would enable policymakers to develop an understanding of the most appropriate and efficient allocation of the costs of searching for owners.','http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2208163','http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2208163',1,0,1,'The paper identifies four general categories of responses to the “who participates?” question in\nrecent proposals.'),('Hansen_and_Walden_(2012)','Hansen and Walden (2012)','http://www.copyrightevidence.org/evidence-wiki/index.php/Hansen_and_Walden_(2012)',2012,'The Role of Restrictiveness of Use in Determining Ethical and Legal Awareness of Unauthorized File Sharing','A host of different types of information goods are available for free download from illegal file sharing sites. As far as price is concerned, no company can compete against “free.” Hence, managers, researchers, and policy makers are interested in determining factors other than price that might influence consumers’ file sharing behavior. Moral consideration is one factor that might sway individuals to pay for files they could otherwise obtain for free. To help better understand how moral consideration works in the context of file sharing, this research examines how people form perceptions of the legality and ethicalness of downloading music files through file sharing. We propose that when people receive files in a more restrictive manner (e.g. streaming vs. downloading) they are less likely to recognize file sharing as being unethical or illegal. We conduct five studies to test our theory of restrictiveness. The results consistently indicate that consumers’ perceptions of legality and ethicalness of file sharing are associated with restrictiveness of use. In particular, while file sharing with different levels of restrictiveness still transfers intellectual property from one individual to another, increased restrictiveness results in consumers being less likely to identify file sharing as being illegal or unethical. This in turn has a great impact on their actual engagement in the unauthorized file sharing activities. We find the relationships are significant even when controlling for several other elements such as gender, age, income, and prior knowledge about how and where to go on the internet to participate in file sharing.','Main results of studies:\n\n*The results of our three studies consistently demonstrate that typical people do not think file sharing is unethical per se, or even illegal per se.\n\n*People often do not really know whether file sharing is ethical and/or legal and they  make judgments based on the particular circumstances and their own limited, or nonexistent, copyright law expertise.\n\n*Subjects with similar personal moral development assigned different ethical and legal dimensions to different stages of perceived property rights transfer. That is, the perceived restrictiveness of a transfer (i.e., streaming a song online versus listening to a tangible CD) affected consumers’ ethical and legal stances. \n\n*This suggests that many consumers may feel they are acting consistently with their ethical and legal views when they participate in forms of unauthorized file sharing because they do not “see” a “physical” transfer of property rights. \n\n*Variation in ethical and legal perceptions arises not only between individuals, but also between circumstances.\n\n*Not only are more consumers likely to view situations that are more restrictive as ethical, but they are more likely to participate in those situations.','Policy implications: \n\n*The results of this study sggest that typical people are more sophisticated in their view toward file sharing than the industry gives them credit for. The results suggest that most consumers view that there ethically and legally should be some allowance for subsequent reuse, but that such reuse should also have boundaries. Further research is needed to more clearly establish what the boundaries are for restrictiveness of use.\n\n*Industry practitioners attempting to develop campaigns based on the results contained in this article should be aware that research has found that consumers more often follow social norms rather than requests from corporations. this should have some bearing on the design of advertising campaigns.\n\n*Consumers’ restrictiveness judgments appear to be compounded by notions of “time” and “location”. That is, while most consumers believe in something like the hypernorm “thou shalt not steal,\" stealing, as an activity, becomes increasingly fuzzy in intellectual property rights that are (for the most part) bound by time and location (i.e., geography).\n\n*A more-effective approach to limiting file sharing is to educate people about how much they are really sharing and with whom they are really sharing.','http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1311988','http://web.b.ebscohost.com.ezproxy.lib.gla.ac.uk/ehost/detail/detail?vid=2&sid=630b348e-c803-41b1-b576-92fa8f8620a8%40sessionmgr112&hid=101&bdata=JnNpdGU9ZWhvc3QtbGl2ZQ%3d%3d',0,0,0,'Theory Development: Thirty-four undergraduate students participated in one of two focus groups at different U.S. universities on consumer media file sharing exchanges in partial fulfillment of a course requirement.\n\nStudy 1: Respondents comprised 473 consumers from 20 states in the United States (out of approximately 600 invited, for a 77% response rate) who completed the within-sample experimental design study.

The Review was needed, the PM said, because of the risk that the current intellectual property framework might not be sufficiently well designed to promote innovation and growth in the UK economy.\n\nIn the five months we have had to compile the Review, we have sought never to lose sight of David Cameron’s “exam question”. Could it be true that laws designed more than three centuries ago with the express purpose of creating economic incentives for innovation by protecting creators’ rights are today obstructing innovation and economic growth?\n\nThe short answer is: yes. We have found that the UK’s intellectual property framework, especially with regard to copyright, is falling behind what is needed. Copyright, once the exclusive concern of authors and their publishers, is today preventing medical researchers studying data and text in pursuit of new treatments. Copying has become basic to numerous industrial processes, as well as to a burgeoning service economy based upon the internet. The UK cannot afford to let a legal framework designed around artists impede vigorous participation in these emerging business sectors.\n\nThis does not mean, however, that we must put our hugely important creative industries at risk. Indeed, these businesses too need change, in the form of more open, contestable and effective global markets in digital content and a setting in which enforcement of copyright becomes effective once more.\n\nThe Review sets out how this can be achieved. We have focused upon the main issues, at the risk of ignoring important points of detail, and have tried to set out a clear, strategic argument, supported with just ten recommendations. We are also making available online a number of documents which explore the available evidence and submissions made to the Review. If the Review’s recommendations are followed, the result will be more innovation and more economic growth.\n\nOur intellectual property framework will face further significant pressure to adapt in the coming years, as we make our way into the third decade of the commercial internet. We urge Government to ensure that in future, policy on Intellectual Property issues is constructed on the basis of evidence, rather than weight of lobbying, and to ensure that the institutions upon which we depend to deliver intellectual property policy have clear mandates and adaptive capability. Without that, the pile of IP reviews on the Government’s doorstep – four in the last six years – will continue to accumulate.','* The UK’s intellectual property framework, especially with regard to copyright, is falling behind what is needed. \n\n* Copyright, once the exclusive concern of authors and their publishers, is today preventing medical researchers studying data and text in pursuit of new treatments. \n\n* Copying has become basic to numerous industrial processes, as well as to a burgeoning service economy based upon the internet. \n\n* The UK cannot afford to let a legal framework designed around artists impede vigorous participation in these emerging business sectors.\n\nThe review made 10 main policy recommendations that can be found below.','This review (widely referred to as Hargreaves Review) makes 10 distinct policy recommendations. A number of these a concerned largely with issues surrounding patent law. However, the majority are relevant to copyright policy.\n\n1. Evidence: Government should ensure that development of the IP System is driven as far as possible by objective evidence. Policy should balance measurable economic objectives against social goals and potential benefits for rights holders against impacts on consumers and other interests. These concerns will be of particular importance in assessing future claims to extend rights or in determining desirable limits to rights.\n\n2. International priorities: The UK should resolutely pursue its international interests in IP, particularly with respect to emerging economies such as China and India, based upon positions grounded in economic evidence. It should attach the highest immediate priority to achieving a unified EU patent court and EU patent system, which promises significant economic benefits to UK business. The UK should work to make the Patent Cooperation Treaty a more effective vehicle for international processing of patent applications.\n\n3. Copyright licensing:\n• In order to boost UK firms’ access to transparent, contestable and global digital markets, the UK should establish a cross sectoral Digital Copyright Exchange. Government should appoint a senior figure to oversee its design and implementation by the end of 2012. A range of incentives and disincentives will be needed to encourage rights holders and others to take part. Governance should reflect the interests of participants, working to an agreed code of practice.\n• The UK should support moves by the European Commission to establish a framework for cross border copyright licensing, with clear benefits to the UK as a major exporter of copyright works. Collecting societies should be required by law to adopt codes of practice, approved by the IPO and the UK competition authorities, to ensure that they operate in a way that is consistent with the further development of efficient, open markets.\n\n4. Orphan works: The Government should legislate to enable licensing of orphan works. This should establish extended collective licensing for mass licensing of orphan works, and a clearance procedure for use of individual works. In both cases, a work should only be treated as an orphan if it cannot be found by search of the databases involved in the proposed Digital Copyright Exchange.\n\n5. Limits to copyright: Government should firmly resist over regulation of activities which do not prejudice the central objective of copyright, namely the provision of incentives to creators. Government should deliver copyright exceptions at national level to realise all the opportunities within the EU framework, including format shifting, parody, non-commercial research, and library archiving. The UK should also promote at EU level an exception to support text and data analytics. The UK should give a lead at EU level to develop a further copyright exception designed to build into the EU framework adaptability to new technologies. This would be designed to allow uses enabled by technology of works in ways which do not directly trade on the underlying creative and expressive purpose of the work. The Government should also legislate to ensure that these and other copyright exceptions are protected from override by contract.\n\n6. Patent thickets and other obstructions to innovation: In order to limit the effects of these barriers to innovation, the Government should:\n• take a leading role in promoting international efforts to cut backlogs and manage the boom in patent applications by further extending “work sharing” with patent offices in other countries;\n• work to ensure patents are not extended into sectors, such as non-technical computer programs and business methods, which they do not currently cover, without clear evidence of benefit;\n• investigate ways of limiting adverse consequences of patent thickets, including by working with international partners to establish a patent fee structure set by reference to innovation and growth goals rather than solely by reference to patent office running costs. The structure of patent renewal fees might be adjusted to encourage patentees to assess more carefully the value of maintaining lower value patents, so reducing the density of patent thickets.\n\n7. The design industry: The role of IP in supporting this important branch of the creative economy has been neglected. In the next 12 months, the IPO should conduct an evidence based assessment of the relationship between design rights and innovation, with a view to establishing a firmer basis for evaluating policy at the UK and European level. The assessment should include exploration with design interests of whether access to the proposed Digital Copyright Exchange would help creators protect and market their designs and help users better achieve legally compliant access to designs.\n\n8. Enforcement of IP rights: The Government should pursue an integrated approach based upon enforcement, education and, crucially, measures to strengthen and grow legitimate markets in copyright and other IP protected fields. When the enforcement regime set out in the DEA becomes operational next year its impact should be carefully monitored and compared with experience in other countries, in order to provide the insight needed to adjust enforcement mechanisms as market conditions evolve. This is urgent and Ofcom should not wait until then to establish its benchmarks and begin building data on trends. In order to support rights holders in enforcing their rights the Government should introduce a small claims track for low monetary value IP claims in the Patents County Court.\n\n9. Small firm access to IP advice: The IPO should draw up plans to improve accessibility of the IP system to smaller companies who will benefit from it. This should involve access to lower cost providers of integrated IP legal and commercial advice.\n\n10. An IP system responsive to change: The IPO should be given the necessary powers and mandate in law to ensure that it focuses on its central task of ensuring that the UK’s IP system promotes innovation and growth through efficient, contestable markets. It should be empowered to issue statutory opinions where these will help clarify copyright law. As an element of improved transparency and adaptability, Government should ensure that by the end of 2013, the IPO publishes an assessment of the impact of those measures advocated in this review which have been accepted by Government.','http://autoblog.leslibres.org/autoblogs/creativecommonsorgweblog_6f7623748a4b5ddd872fd8c2fcd53404e0e69a8a/media/16ae12ee.ipreview-finalreport.pdf','http://autoblog.leslibres.org/autoblogs/creativecommonsorgweblog_6f7623748a4b5ddd872fd8c2fcd53404e0e69a8a/media/16ae12ee.ipreview-finalreport.pdf',0,0,0,'The Hargreaves Review covers the 4 core elements of IP: Copyright, Designs, Patents and Trademarks.\n\nThe review draws on a broad range of primary (research commissioned for the report and responses to calls for evidence) and secondary sources.\n\nThe primary source data includes research commissioned by Hargreaves including: Greenhalgh & Rogers (2011), PACEC (2011) The VoD Sector and TNS-BMRB (2011). \n\nIn addition to this commissioned research the review issued a call for evidence.

Specifically, does it matter if the source of advice has a stake in the outcome of the piracy decision? Does it matter if the source of advice has a social tie with the advisee? Accordingly, we conduct a laboratory experiment using teenagers and their parents as subjects, increasing the realism of the context by sampling potential pirates and their parents. Treatments represent various sources of piracy advice (e.g., the teen\'s parent, a record label, or an external regulator). Subjects make decisions playing our new experimental game—The Piracy Game—extended from the volunteer\'s dilemma literature. Interestingly, subjects respond negatively to advice from record labels over time, purchasing fewer songs as compared to other sources such as the subject\'s parent. The existence of a social tie between the adviser and the subject assists in mitigating piracy, especially when a parent is facing potential penalties due to his or her child\'s behavior. An external regulator, having no social tie or stake in the decision, provides the least credible source of advice, leading to the greatest amount of piracy. Our analyses not only provide managerial insights but also develop theoretical understanding of the role of social ties in the context of advice.','- Digital good providers have tried various approaches to educate potential pirates about the implications of piracy to encourage them to purchase. Yet, there is little analysis done on the implication of the educational strategies. To fill this gap, this paper investigates the implications of the source of advice on both pirating and purchasing decisions. The study is among the first to include both parents and their children in a behavioral/experimental economics study.\n\n- Results indicate that when there is a tangible stake for the parent for their child’s actions, purchasing behavior by the child is significantly increased, and pirating behavior is slightly decreased.\n\n- Even when there is not a stake for the parents (e.g., potential litigation), the advice is most effective when the advisor has a stronger social tie (parent as opposed to the record label or a regulator). On the contrary, when the record label provides advice, the profit generated surprisingly results in the worst outcome.','Although the industry is attempting to shift to education strategies (e.g., Pyyny, 2003; RIAA, 2009, 2011a,b; Stewart-Robertson, 2010), in lieu of litigation (or technology controls for that matter), the current status quo of sending advice directly from 3rd parties could certainly be improved by coordinating advice through channels with greater social ties to the pirates.','http://www.researchgate.net/profile/Matthew_Hashim/publication/228296003_Digital_Piracy_Teens_and_the_Source_of_Advice_An_Experimental_Study/links/02e7e533ec34a6adfd000000.pdf','http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.2753/MIS0742-1222310208',0,0,0,'The experiment was conducted in the Vernon Smith Experimental Economics Laboratory at Purdue University during the summer and fall of 2011.

However, the most of technological protection measures used so far were quickly circumvented after their introduction. This led to the development and use of more and more advanced technological protection measures, which were also quickly circumvented after their introduction. Therefore, the conventional view on the efficiency of using technological protection measures is that their use leads to a vicious circle of their circumvention and upgrading. \n\nTo examine the efficiency of technological protection measures, we conducted an online survey in Japan. A random sample of 1,252 internet users was asked to respond to a series of multiple-choice questions on their consumption of copyrighted works and their acceptance of or objection to selected restrictions on various uses of copyrighted works. By analyzing collected data, we identified that an individual’s decision on the acceptance or rejection of such technological and other restrictions on using copyrighted works is affected by factors such as gender, type of copyrighted works, perception of justified use, and actual use of copyright works. In addition, we observed considerable differences between the importance of individual types of copyrighted works and their uses for consumers. Some types of copyrighted works and their uses were more important for respondents than others. In many cases, the respondents’ judgments were consistent with the current copyright law and practice in Japan. However, there are several significant issues where their judgment considerably differs, especially with regard to recent changes in Japanese copyright law aiming to strengthen copyright enforcement in the digital environment. This can considerably undermine the efficiency of those changes in copyright law.','* Results showed that the most problematic restriction in respondents’ opinions was on time-shifting of broadcasted TC programs. Less problematic were the restrictions on sound recording on live popular music concerts. Somewhere in the middle was restriction on copying movie DVDs and Blu-ray Discs. \n* The online survey revealed there are considerable differences between the importance of individual types of copyrighted works and their uses for consumers. Some types of works and uses are more important for consumers than others. \n* If the individual considers the restriction as justified, there is a higher likelihood that she will confirm with such restriction and will not try to circumvent it in any way.','* Differences in the importance of individual types of copyrighted works and their uses can explain why similar technological and other protection measures works with some types of copyrighted works and fails with the others.',NULL,'http://www.serci.org/2013/hazucha-serci-2013.pdf',0,0,0,'Data was collected by using an online service through MyVoice Communications, Inc. for making public opinion polls.

We attempt to objectively place a value on the body of public domain photographs and illustrations which are used in this global resource. We find that the most historically remote subjects are more likely to have images on their web pages because their biographical life-spans pre-date the existence of in-copyright imagery. We find that the large majority of photos and illustrations used on subject pages were obtained from the public domain, and we estimate their value in terms of costs saved to Wikipedia page builders and in terms of increased traffic corresponding to the inclusion of an image.

That study, however, did not account for the number people who viewed each movie in the theater. Since the debate over copyright term extension centers on the continuing “availability” of works as they fall into the public domain, a better measure of the availability of songs in movies would account for the relative box office success of the movies in which the songs appear. The present study collects box office data for hundreds of movies from 1968-2008 in which appeared hundreds of songs and concludes that public domain songs were heard by just as many people in movie theaters before and after they fell into the public domain.','This paper examines accounts for the number tickets sold in order to measure popularity, and therefore the number of viewers of each movie while it played in theatres.

They assert that works in the public domain may be under-exploited due to the lack of property rights or over-exploited due to congestion externalities.  This study compares the availability, number of editions, and prices of 166 public domain bestsellers published from 1913-1922 with 168 copyrighted bestsellers from 1923-32.  It also compares the 20 most enduringly popular public domain works from 1913-22 with the 20 most enduring popular protected works from 1923-32.  A significantly higher percentage of the public domain books are still in print, with significantly more editions available per book, and for the sub-set of especially durable works, the public domain works are significantly less expensive.  Although the data show that rates of availability for both kinds of books are likely sensitive to reductions in the cost of duplication and distribution, the study concludes that protection of fiction beyond the period necessary to ensure its creation is not justified by concerns about under-exploitation.  The possibility of congestion presented by the data is also tentatively rejected.','*Although the general trend for both sets of works shows increased availability over time, there is no statistically significant difference between the availability of the public domain works and copyrighted works between1988-2001.  Around 2001, however, the public domain works trend sharply upwards in terms of in-print status, reaching 98% in 2006, while only 74% of the books in the copyrighted data set are in print in 2006. \n\n*Something significant happened around 2001. Comparative availability varies between 1988 and 2001, with some years  showing more public domain books in print, and other years showing more copyrighted books in print.  On the average, the copyrighted books are ten years younger than the public domain books, which may have resulted in marginally increased demand, driving up their availability.  On the other hand, publishers of public domain books did not have to pay a licensing fee, which made those titles marginally cheaper to print.  In 2001, the availability curves disentangle and the in-print status for public domain works approaches 100% in 2004-2006.  It may be that improvements in optical scanning technology and software, lower costs of that technology, and the emergence of new business models allowed publishers of public domain materials to take advantage of the royalty-free status of such works, making it possible to satisfy the small demand for the least popular titles in the data set.','* The data presented herein clearly suggest that the public domain status of popular books does not result in under-exploitation.  Although the public domain books in the data set are on the average ten years older than the copyrighted books, they are in print at a higher rate and have more editions available by more different publishers. If one considers only the sub-set of the most valuable books, then a significant difference in price can be measured, confirming economists’ suspicions about deadweight losses associated with the extension of copyright protection.   The only arguable benefit to offset these losses would be the reduction of possible congestion externalities.  In the context of books (unlike trademarks and perhaps celebrity personae) where the public is never forced to overconsume the product, it seems highly unlikely that the multiplicity of editions shown in the data demonstrate any such externalities. \n\n* In general, the data show a highly competitive and robust market for the production of public domain books.  Markets for other products, such as movies, music and software, where technology has made the cost of reproduction extremely low, are likely to behave in much the same way.  Although market failure is possible, the burden should be on the party arguing in favor of central control of the production of a good in an apparently competitive market.','http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=955954','http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=955954',0,0,0,'The primary data set consists of 334 bestselling books collected from three sources.

Whereas industry advocates and some scholars postulate a cannibalistic effect on commercial forms of movie consumption, other researchers deny this effect, though sound evidence is lacking on both sides. Drawing on extant research and utility theory, the authors present hypotheses on the consequences and determinants of consumer file sharing and test them with data from a controlled longitudinal panel study of German consumers. The data contain information on the consumers\' intentions toward and actual behavior in relation to the consumption of 25 new motion pictures, allowing the authors to study more than 10,000 individual file-sharing opportunities. The authors test the effect of file sharing on commercial movie consumption using a series of ReLogit regression analyses and apply partial least squares structural equation modeling to identify the determinants of consumer file sharing. They find evidence of substantial cannibalization of theater visits, DVD rentals, and DVD purchases responsible for annual revenue losses of $300 million in Germany. Five categories of file-sharing behavior drive file sharing and have a significant impact on how consumers obtain and watch illegal movie copies.','* Through the longitudinal study, the following statistics were produced:\n** Of the 25 movies in the sample, 136 respondents (17%) had obtained at least one illegal copy before the movies were released on DVD; 242 illegal movie copies had been obtained by that time and 165 of these copies had been watched. \n** Respondents intended to watch an illegal copy in 21.1% of cases before the theatrical release and 13.1% of cases before the DVD release. \n** After the movies were released to DVD, 141 respondents (18.5%) had obtained at least one copy of a surveyed movie; overall 342 illegal movie copies had been obtained by the time of the third survey, and 66% of those illegal copies had been watched. At this point, the maximum number of illegal copies that individual respondents obtained was 11. \n* Consumers’ intentions to view an illegal copy of a new movie reduce their propensity to attend theaters. This suggests that file-sharing intentions limit the consumer’s interest in legal channel consumption, which in turn leads him to forgo consumption in these channels, regardless of whether the consumer actually obtains an illegal copy of the movie or not. \n* Consumers’ intentions to watch a movie copy significantly reduce their number of DVD rentals and purchases. \n* Researchers calculated an overall annual industry loss of $300 million in Germany, which represents approximately 9.4% of the total industry revenues in 2005.','* Although nationwide estimates represent bold numbers for the impact of file sharing, it is likely they are exaggerated. \n* Consumers’ intentions to engage in file sharing cause them to forego theater visits, legal DVD rentals and purchases.

We build on an Internet survey (N=6,083) we conducted to Finnish users in 2007. Using the survey data we examine how the respondents’ socio-demographic characteristics associate the file-sharing. We also examine whether knowledge of law has any impact on file-sharing behaviour. We find that the frequent and the infrequent P2P-users share several common attributes with each other. Frequent users are clearly more often male than female, are younger, and possess lower educational qualifications than infrequent users. The results also indicate that the people who are active in P2P-users have weaker legal knowledge about digital copyright issues. The findings and the use of the survey method carry implications for legal and social science scholar work that examines the illegal file-sharing phenomenon.','Frequent P2P file-sharers / downloaders are:\n* Significantly likely more often to be male than female – 2.4:1 in this sample\n* Significantly more likely to be in a younger age group (age ≤ 24) when compared with those in the oldest age group (age > 35)\n* More likely to have lower educational qualifications than infrequent P2P users\n* More likely to have weaker legal knowledge about digital copyright issues than infrequent P2P users.\n\nThose who disagree with the statement that it is condemnable to share unauthorized files are much more likely (3.5:1) to be frequent P2P users than those who agree. In addition, those respondents who feel neutral about this statement are also more often frequent users when compared to disagreeing respondents (almost 1.9:1).','Rights owners who want to affect illegal file sharing should concentrate their efforts on changing the moral values of 18 to 24 year-old males. However, this might be an impossible task, partly because illegal file sharing is experienced as either as a victimless crime, or one where the victim is seen as a rich and remote “Hollywood star”.\n\nThe results partly explain why the Pirate movement in Scandinavia has its strongest support in its youth chapters. Young adults don’t have moral obstacles when demanding the legalisation of file sharing, and don’t see that their actions cause harm. This is the reason why rights owners’ attempts to change moral values has had only a limited impact on file sharing.','http://www.researchgate.net/profile/Pekka_Raesaenen/publication/228189633_Reasons_Affecting_Frequency_of_File-Sharing_among_Finnish_Internet_Users/links/02bfe50f5b3ab44be5000000.pdf','http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1414209',0,0,0,'6,083 complete responses from P2P survey data collected by Hietanen, Huttunen and Kokkinen (2007), through a questionnaire on three online newspaper sites, Sep-Oct 2007.

This supports Hirschi and Gottfredson’s (1993) assertion that self-control is impacted by constraints. The constraint in this case is the need for individuals to learn how to perform digital piracy. The authors suggest that universities seeking to reduce digital piracy should consider developing policies and programs based on social learning theory. Participants were 392 college students who completed a self-report questionnaire measuring aspects of social control, association with digital pirating peers, attitudes toward software piracy, and intentions to commit digital piracy. The analysis involved the use of structural equation modeling to test how four models of low self-control and social learning combined to produce the commission of digital piracy. Future research should use different measures of digital piracy and should consider the theoretical links that low self-control has with other theories in terms of their contribution to explaining digital piracy.

This paper outlines the structure \nand operation of entrepreneurial organizations in the most speculative segments of three cultural industries :  book publishing, phonograph records and motion pictures. Commercial \"cultural\" products are conceived as “non-material\"  goods, directed at a mass public of consumers, for whom they serve an \"esthetic,\" rather than  a clearly \"utilitarian\" purpose. Three adaptive \"coping\"  strategies are set forth and  examined:  the deployment of \"contact\" men to organizational boundaries; overproductioll and differential promotion of new items; and the  cooptation of mass media gatekeepers.  The concept of  an \"industry system\" is proposed as a useful frame of reference in which to trace the filtering of new products and ideas as they flow from producer to consumer, and in which to examine relations among organizations.  This substantive area, seldom viewed  from an organizational perspective, is then related to a growing body of literature in the sub-field of interorganizational relations.','The paper outline s the structure and operation of entrepreneurial organizations engaged in the production and mass distribution of three  types of \"cultural\" items:  books, recordings and  motion pictures.  Focusing  specifically on publishing houses, movie production companies and record companies.\nThe paper outlined 3 main strategies employed to limit dependence of elements in their “task environment” and to fight constraints on output distribution imposed by gatekeepers and contingencies in recruiting creative material. \n\n# Using contact men  in organisational boundaries:  The role of the contact men who are talent scouts, promoters, press agents etc. is to link cultural organisations with the artist community\n# Differential promotion of new items and overproduction:  This is in response to low capital investment and demand uncertainty. This causes resources such as promotional materials to be distributed unevenly with emphasis on only a few items. There is thus an expectation that many new cultural items will fail.\n# Cooptation of mass media gatekeepers: An example of this would be a record company advertising in the trade press or encouraging a gatekeeper, which could be a popular radio station, to cover their new artist. This however conflicts with the interest of the gatekeeper, because if done too much it could affect the reputation of the gatekeeper negatively.  \nThe authors conclude by introducing the concept of “industrial systems” as a frame of reference to trace the flow of  new products/ideas as they are filtered at each level or organisation and to examine  relationships among organisations.','A greater degree of independence of cultural organizations from mass media gatekeepers might result in the former avoiding the most costly and illegitimate tactics when attempting to co-opt autonomous consumer surrogates.','http://www.researchgate.net/publication/247266573_Processing_Fads_and_Fashions_An_Organization-Set_Analysis_of_Cultural_Industry_Systems','www.jstor.org/stable/2776751',0,0,0,'To gather data the author conducted an extensive sampling of trade papers directed at members of the movie, music and book publishing industries,. primarily:  -  Publishers\' Weekly, Billboard and Variety.

Furthermore, this difference seems to increase with the retail price of the original.\n\n*If the marginal cost were zero, optimal pricing would lead the firm to cut prices by 80%. Even if such a price cut were made almost 50% of the computer generation subjects would still get an illegal copy. If marginal cost is one fifth of the original retail price (i.e., SEK 200) optimal pricing lead the firm to cut prices by 50%. If this price cut were made 86% of the subjects would still get an illegal copy.','Policy implications:\n\n*The results have implications for the firms’ and authorities’ anti-piracy strategies. The price elasticity of piracy indicates that the piracy rate is quite insensitive to price cuts for most price intervals. This suggests that moderate price cuts are likely to be a rather inefficient method to fight piracy in the computer generation.\n\n*The author found that although a pricing option exists, price cuts would hardly delimit piracy to a larger extent and the extra revenues earned from groups inclined to piracy would be low due to very low optimal prices.

Therefore, this study examined whether low self-control and deviant peer associations explained various forms of cyberdeviance in a youth sample. We also tested whether associating with deviant peers mediated the effect of low self-control on cyberdeviance as well as whether it conditioned the effect. Low self-control and deviant peer associations were found to be related to cyberdeviance in general, as well as piracy, harassment, online pornography, and hacking specifically. Deviant peer associations both mediated and exacerbated the effect of low self-control on general cyberdeviance, though these interactions were not found for the five cyberdeviant types examined.','This study found that deviant peer groups had a greater influence on illegal downloading of media than low self-control; non-deviant peer groups could mitigate some of the low self-control effect on cyberdeviance.

We address the role of on-line interactions in spreading subcultural knowledge by interviewing 34 persistent digital pirates and performing a non-participant ethnography of an on-line forum devoted to piracy. Our results show that through on-line interactions, pirates learn the norms and values of digital piracy, including how to recognize and avoid risks associated with pirating and how to make sense of and justify their actions.

We are supporting two main database projects which will also act as exemplars of what good looks like: the Global Repertoire Database in music publishing where Performing Rights Society (PRS for Music) has been a prime motivator and the Global Recording Database with a similar role played by Phonographic Performance Limited (PPL). The aspiration is for collecting societies around the world to be able to draw on one authoritative database which is kept updated (a key requirement for rights databases), replacing multiple databases where the data conflicts and is not kept up to date.\n\n* We are supporting the Linked Content Coalition (LCC), an international project that emanated from the European Publishers Council, but is now moving into new sectors beyond publishing. The LCC is all about developing a common language and a set of communications standards so proper interoperability is achieved, a very real and necessary building block for the Copyright Hub and its associated databases and DCEs.\n\n*We recommend that: The organisations engaged in licensing content to schools and colleges should offer these licences for sale through an intermediary or aggregator thus in effect creating a ‘one stop shop’ for licensing for educational institutions. This will reduce the number of individual organisations that educational institutions have to deal with to obtain licences (currently around twelve) and should reduce the transaction costs involved in this process.\n\n* We recommend: That the music industry continues to find ways to make the licensing of new digital services over the fixed and mobile internet easier, more automated where appropriate and more accessible. This is and will be done by new types of blanket licensing, by direct licensing and by combinations of blanket and direct licensing. The challenge of direct licensing is to keep the number of different organisations a licensee has to deal with to a sensible minimum.

Music file sharing has been deemed illegal in many countries and is quite detrimental to record labels around the world. The music industry is looking for a business model that would let it tap into the new mode of file-sharing consumption. Until now music file-sharing behavior has not been systematically analyzed in the literature. This paper presents an analytical framework by looking at music file-sharing behavior from the perspectives of moral judgment, expertise, and social networking, and then presents a conceptual model of sharing through a set of hypotheses. An empirical study based on the model provides in-depth insights into sharing behavior. The paper concludes with a discussion of implications and further research possibilities.','This Article aims at proposing a model of consumer behavior which accounts for a better understanding of music piracy. The model mainly considers the moral judgment perspective, the expertise perspective, and the social networking perspective, and it investigates their interrelationships with consumers’ intensity of music file sharing. More specifically, this paper shows that:\n\n* The higher the degree to which consumers judge file sharing to be morally right, the more likely they are to have the expertise to share files.\n\n* A higher level of sharing expertise leads to more intense sharing behavior.\n\n* Entrenched knowledge of old modes of music consumption inhibits a consumer from taking advantage of sharing as a social networking opportunity.\n\n* The social networking orientation of file sharing lessens, rather than heightens, the intensity of music file-sharing behavior.','- The music industry value chain that found its ground in mass production cannot guarantee the survival of market players in the postmodern consumption condition where consumers are capable of reproduction and distribution, digitally and therefore perfectly.\n\n- Consumers\' perceptions that a producer is unfair give them a self-righteous excuse for infringing on the producer\'s copyright.',NULL,'http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/10864415.2003.11044343',0,0,0,'A sample of 187 senior students who took one of three marketing-related elective courses at a local university in Taiwan was surveyed to provide data for the empirical study.'),('Hudson_and_Kenyon_(2007)','Hudson and Kenyon (2007)','http://www.copyrightevidence.org/evidence-wiki/index.php/Hudson_and_Kenyon_(2007)',2007,'Digital Access: The Impact of Copyright on Digitisation Practices in Australian Museums, Galleries, Libraries, and Archives.','Empirical research into the digitisation of collections in Australian museums, galleries, libraries and archives suggests that copyright law affects what material is digitised and how it is made accessible.

Theoretically, however, piracy may raise legitimate demand through positive demand-side externalities, sampling, and sharing. Accordingly, the actual impact of piracy on the legitimate demand is an empirical issue. Addressing this issue in the context of recorded music, we develop and test hypotheses from theoretical models of end-user and re-seller piracy on international panel data for music CDs. Empirically, we find that the demand for music CDs decreased with piracy, suggesting that \"theft\" outweighed the \"positive\" effects of piracy. However, the impact of piracy on CD sales was considerably smaller than industry estimates. Further, we estimated that, accounting for both demand losses and price adjustments, the industry lost no more than 6.6% of revenue to piracy.','Main results: \n\n*In theory, piracy may raise the demand for a legitimate information product. If the positive influences were strong enough, they could outweigh the negative effect of piracy due to the theft of customers. \n\n*Our results for music CDs suggest otherwise. The coefficient of the piracy variable was negative and significant. Even if such positive effects did exist, they were more than offset by the harm caused by the loss in sales due to “theft”.\n\n*The data set further allowed the authors to investigate in detail the presence of an indirect network effect, by which higher piracy increases the ownership of CD players, which in turn stimulates the demand for legitimate music CDs. \n\n*The results showed that the demand for legitimate music CDs was indeed positively associated with higher CD player ownership. However, the correlation between the pirated quantity and CD player ownership was quite modest, and not statistically significant. Pirated music did not have a significant complementary effect on the demand for CD players, and hence it might not have contributed to the raising legitimate demand through an indirect network effect.\n\n*The authors estimated that piracy caused legitimate sales to fall by 0.0954 unit per capita. Assuming that prices remained constant, the average revenue lost to piracy would have been 6.6%. This estimate exaggerates the actual revenue loss because it assumes constant prices. It is lower than the revenue loss that we calculated that a monopoly would have suffered.','Policy implications:\n\n*The results suggest that piracy would affect legitimate producers both directly by drawing away demand and indirectly by inducing them to reduce prices: evidence which could have an effect on policy-making in this area.','http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=262651','http://www.emeraldinsight.com/series/cea',0,0,0,'Data sources:\n\n*The authors collected data from multiple sources.

The emerging production ecology that involves new kinds of distributed organisations and ad-hoc networks epitomises the ‘drift of value’ from producer to consumer and allows us to understand how user-led innovation influences the creative industries. But the ability to control intellectual property rights in content production is critical to the power structures and social dynamic that are being created in this space. Trainz, a train simulation game released by Brisbane developer Auran, which relies heavily on fan created content for its success is used as a case study. The licence agreements between Auran and the fan\ncreators are analysed in order to understand how the balance between the commercial and non-commercial is achieved and how the tension between open networks of collaboration and closed structures of commercial competitive environments are negotiated. It explains the intellectual property issues involved and highlights how the interface between copyright and contract will have a critical impact on this example of user led innovation.','The great challenge in this environment in the next few years will be over who controls the IP – a complex mosaic of rights in the digital estate – and how. Power here comes very much from an ability to leverage off an intellectual property base (such as copyright in code or visuals). The critical question will be the extent to which commercial entities can acknowledge fan based ownership as part of the ‘drift of value’ (Hartley, 2004) from producer to consumer. Auran provide an interesting approach which is responsive to the needs of the fan developers and in most respects provides a best practice model. That cannot be said for all platform owners. The\nimmediate challenge is to conceptualise a commercial and legal framework that will best facilitate the new dimensions of distributed production networks in games and other emergent areas of the creative industries. The dilemma is: the more user led IP is regulated through contract, the greater the potential for stifling user led innovation; yet the less contractual restructuring the platform owner can demand, the more circumscribed and limited will be the development framework.','From the userdevelopers’ perspective the only acceptable solution is one that embeds in law, not\njust practice, the fundamental rights of those at the forefront of user led innovation. The counter argument will be that fan based productivity would be significantly reduced if it were not for the investment of the platform owner. The sensible and effective resolution of these competing claims will not only act to provide balance to the games landscape but it will also be vital to facilitating the future of user based production more generally across creative industries.','https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Nicolas_Suzor/publication/27466470_Fan_based_production_for_computer_games_User_led_innovation_the_\'drift_of_value\'_and_the_negotiation_of_intellectual_property_rights/links/00463523b94c584c70000000.pdf','http://mia.sagepub.com/content/114/1/16.short',0,0,0,'This study consists of data from a case study of a games developer and analysis of the contracts it forms with fan creators.'),('Humphreys_(2008)','Humphreys (2008)','http://www.copyrightevidence.org/evidence-wiki/index.php/Humphreys_(2008)',2008,'The challenges of intellectual property for users of social networking sites: a case study of Ravelry','This paper examines how the complexity of motivations and practices found in a specialist social networking site intersect with the institution of intellectual property (IP). IP is a set of conventions and legal practices which evolved in a very different environment of production and distribution. In a co-creative social networking site we find a concatenation of amateurs, semiprofessionals and professionals, occupying multiple roles in gifting economies, reputation economies, monetised charitable economies and full commercial economies. People use, buy, sell, give away, and consume in this mixed economy that can be characterised as a \'social network market\'. The users of online social networking sites (SNS) find themselves having to come to grips with the complexity of IP law in order to participate fully. This paper uses Ravelry, a specialist SNS for knitters and spinners, to analyse the negotiations that take place around IP in a social network market, in particular the way the discourse of copyright is mobilised to negotiate the territory between amateurs and professionals.','Copyright and intellectual property are not completely irrelevant as mechanisms of regulation, but there is a problem if a regulatory mechanism is in play that most people have very poor literacy\nwith, and in fact even most trained legal people admit to uncertainty over. If a simple request for clarification generates a thread with over 80 posts and almost inevitably ends with “you need to consult an attorney”, then there is a problem. While discussion leads to some literacy, in fact the general effect seems to be off-putting rather than encouraging of people learning more.\nIn the resulting confusions moral rather than legal discourses seem to drive some of the decisions made to publish or not, even though negotiations are couched around copyright. The frictions between amateurs and professionals, or the social and financial economies of a social network market, are played out on the field of IP. \nThe Ravelry site owners are in the process of designing some standard Creative Commons style licenses for designers to use if they choose, but acknowledge that these will not fulfill the\nneeds of all designers in all jurisdictions. They are partly hoping that the licenses will serve an educational function for buyers by making clear what they are able to do with the patterns they are either purchasing or being given for free. The Ravelry standard licenses, if they eventuate, will serve some different purposes to the CC licenses. CC licenses are designed to give users a larger set of permissions than copyright, in advance, thus obviating the\nneed for a user to contact the owner for those permissions. Ravelry licenses may serve a similar function but some classes will serve to limit rather than expand the permissions, and will thus require a click through style of consent to the contractual arrangement. Without such a procedure the contracts would not be considered valid by a court.','The broader issues implied through this case study are about the need both for simplification and\nflexibility in intellectual property law and the need for developing new literacies in legal matters in communities of users. The use of IP as an ideological tool in the service of creating a largely commercial environment is interesting, but the success of this strategy is not by any means a foregone conclusion.','http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1457227','http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1457227',0,0,0,'This study uses data from a Social Networking Site case study, knitting pattern site Ravelry, and analyses data and discourse from the publicly available discussion boards on the site.'),('Hunt,_Williams,_Nicholas_and_Rowlands_(2009)','Hunt, Williams, Nicholas and Rowlands (2009)','http://www.copyrightevidence.org/evidence-wiki/index.php/Hunt,_Williams,_Nicholas_and_Rowlands_(2009)',2009,'Copycats?

While some broadcasters – especially those in developing economies - still utilise traditional analogue transmission techniques, most have transitioned to more efficient and powerful digital means of sending their programming to viewers. Use of digital technologies has enabled explosive growth in the number of channels and choices of programmes offered. It has also ceded more control to the viewer, allowing on-demand access to programming – not only from broadcasters and pay TV service providers, but also increasingly from online video services delivered over the open Internet. Indeed, as this report outlines, the definitional boundaries between broadcasting and other forms of digital video delivery are increasingly blurred. \n\nThe viewer is undoubtedly a winner as a result of these developments as we move ever closer to the ultimate provision of ubiquitous choice, convenience and control. And broadcasters are usually winners too as evidenced by the impressive global TV market growth described in this report. Inevitably, that growth and technological development is not evenly distributed geographically, and we outline some of the key regional trends in the pages that follow, as well as some more focused snapshots of the market evolution within selected countries.\n\nHowever, this report also highlights a paradox at the heart of this technological revolution; namely, that the ceding of ever more control to the viewer also inevitably means an increasing risk that broadcasters lose control of their programming. It becomes harder and harder to prevent unauthorised access to the copyrighted content that traverses the globe at lightning speeds as digital ‘bits’. This poses an ever greater threat to the economics of intellectual property that sustain the broadcast and related industries.','* Television has been transformed by the emergence of digital technologies and the internet. However, while the online TV sector has been growing since 2009, traditional pay TV still accounts for the majority of TV revenues. Television has remained similarly resilient in the advertising market, where it maintains the highest share of advertising revenue across all media. \n\n* Online video is currently growing complementarily to TV advertising, but some cannibalization is starting to be observed in the European Nordic region. Television and video delivery platforms are becoming increasingly complex as viewing preferences move towards a world in which content is available on-demand and in a device agnostic manner. The move to digital from analogue delivery methods has been a key trend among traditional television platforms, since digitisation offers less constraint on the number of channels available to viewers. \n\n* The development of the internet has also seen the growth of online video platforms, which has given rise to changing behaviours of viewers around the world, as well as new competitors to traditional TV players. \n\n* Mobile video consumption is growing rapidly, driven by the growth in smartphone adoption and advanced 4G mobile data networks. However, direct monetisation of mobile video is challenging, with users opting for free services or video delivered as part of a wider premium pay TV or online video subscription, for which there is no additional fee for mobile access.\n\n* The digitisation of all content has unified delivery platforms, meaning that future technologies a more fluent interchange between different platforms. For example, a satellite TV image can interface with internet content delivered over mobile. This places pressure on video distribution to move towards higher quality video. The cost of this has two aspects: the availability of a network or spectrum to deliver, and the technologies needed to improve the efficiency of delivery over a given network.\n\n* For broadcasters, a drawback of the increasing prevalence of digital technologies and changing viewing behaviour is that the ease of obtaining unauthorised access to copyrighted content has increased. As a result of this, various types of piracy have arisen, which bring with them the risk of broadcasters losing control of their programming, as well as threatening the economics of intellectual property.

Using data from a sample of 2,032 undergraduates from a large Midwestern university, the relevance of neutralization theory is tested via multinomial logistic regression while controlling for other theoretical predictors and demographic variables. The findings indicated that greater acceptance of the techniques associated with denial of responsibility, denial of injury, denial of victim, and appeal to higher loyalties significantly predicted moderate levels of piracy participation. Furthermore, the effect of appeals to higher loyalty on piracy was found to be conditioned by the respondent’s approval of the behavior. Overall, results suggested that university settings may unwittingly facilitate a climate for online piracy whereby students place a higher value on group norms rather than legal norms and do not consider the harms associated with the behavior.','This article aims at assessing neutralization theory’s applicability to online music piracy to determine its empirical validity. It seeks to test the relevance of neutralization techniques to music pirating behavior and examines the proposed nonlinear relationship between acceptance of the techniques and the level of participation in music piracy.

Other results indicate an unexpected openness to an alternative film-distribution method where both the producers and the consumers get an honest deal, presenting options to release the current political and social tension without prosecuting an increasing portion of the population.','- While downloading as a whole is an established activity, its particulars (like the knowledge state and economic interest) are still in constant shift, leading to both a habituation to downloading and an awareness of the expectations.\n\n- The current generation does not harbour a great amount of moral qualms about downloading movies. Added to this are the data which show that variance in the items from moral justification do not correlate significantly with changes in the number of downloads.\n\n- Knowledge of laws is a valued component of expected outcomes, but any direct effect on them is questionable.\n\n- Self-efficacy doesn\'t play a major role in predicting downloading behaviour. A possible reason for this is that downloading movies might not require a great amount of skill; navigating the web and exploring its possibilities is getting progressively less complex.\n\n- As self-efficacy and moral justification influences fade, for an increasing amount of consumers downloading becomes second nature, and an activity that for many seems like a criminal pursuit does not occupy much conscious thought in the minds of downloaders.','As indicated in this study, the number of movies one downloads is heavily influenced by how deeply embedded the behaviour is in the daily routine. In all probability, efforts to reduce downloading movies without paying distributors need to start there. Another method of reducing the tension surrounding downloading movies is to take an in-depth look at what the problem is. While it is outside of the scope of this article to imply there is not an issue, other investigations into profit reductions of media sales have not always correlated these faltering sales with the rise in downloading activity (Oberholzer & Strumpf, 2004). Similarly, the findings in the current study suggest that simply demonizing the downloading community might not be an effective strategy for stakeholders and governments.','http://essay.utwente.nl/59875/1/BSc_R_Jacobs.pdf','http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0747563211002913',0,0,0,'The questionnaire created by the authors was started a total of 436 times.

Evaluations of illegal music downloading and their association with downloading behaviour were examined using social domain theory in a sample of 188 ethnically diverse college students (M.age = 19.80 years, SD = 1.36, 56% female). All students treated prototypical moral events as moral on a domain classification task. Students treated illegal downloading as a complex moral issue and, less frequently, as a personal issue (but rarely as a conventional issue of law or authority); judgments varied when different concerns regarding the fair price of music and the structure of the music industry were made salient. Greater discrepancies between the actual price of music and what students viewed to be fair were associated with past illegal downloading, while a greater focus on downloading as stealing was associated with abstaining from downloading.','The main results reported by this study:\n\n*Students treat illegal downloading as a complex issue entailing conflicts between competing claims. Manipulations in information about the nature of the music industry and the price of music were systematically associated with variations in judgments, and moral beliefs were uniquely associated with past illegal downloading over and above the extent to which individuals viewed music as important in their lives. \n\n*The ability to distinguish between prototypical moral, conventional, personal, and prudential events did not differ between students who had and had not illegally downloaded, casting doubt on the claim that youth who engage in illegal music downloading are more ethically and morally deficient. \n\n*The results of the study suggest that individuals are concerned with balancing the need to pay for music with their own rights as consumers. As reflected in their fair price ratings, the vast majority of participants thought that the current price of music was unfairly high. This was mirrored in their acceptability judgments as well: illegal downloading was judged significantly more wrong when cost was removed as a concern. Rather than reflecting purely pragmatic or economic concerns, these responses also revealed a decidedly moral orientation. \n\n*Nearly all participants (95%) believed that music should cost at least something: challenging the common perception that youth today do not believe in having to pay for music.\n\n*Longitudinal research would be useful to determine how involvement in illegal downloading influences one\'s interpretations of the act over time.','Policy implications reported by the study: \n\n*Recent campaigns aimed at convincing the public that file-sharing is equivalent to more traditional forms of theft may have failed because, for many students, illegal downloading may be viewed as combating what they see as an unjust system that is biased against both consumers and musicians. \n\n*Attempts to curb illegal downloading behaviours must take into account the pressing interests that are salient to those involved.

This Article argues that this foundational belief is wrong. Using recent advances in behavioral economics, psychology, and businessmanagement studies, along with empirical investigations of industry, it is now possible to construct a compelling case that the incentive theory, as a general matter, is mistaken, and that natural and intrinsic motivations will cause technology and the arts to flourish even in the absence of externally supplied rewards. It follows that intellectual property law itself needs a fundamental rethinking.','*  A study commissioned by the U.K. government about the intellectual property system noted correctly that “awareness of the system is a pre-requisite for it to work.” That same study found that the firms “which form the cradle of IP,” those that are medium-sized or smaller, “are in the main effectively unaware of the IP system.”\n\n*  More than two-thirds of respondents for companies with over 250 employees either didn’t know or guessed wrongly that preapplication publication doesn’t surrender patent rights.The persons answering were generally persons in the firm who dealt specifically with intellectual property, or they were among the most senior persons in the entire company.175 For smaller companies, the percentage in the dark was even higher, ranging between 79%  and 89%.','* Avoiding a Fashionable Fallacy. At the outset, the clearest implication of the demonstrated unsoundness of the incentive theory is that legal scholars, judges, and lawmakers should tighten their discourse. We should no longer tolerate easy assertions that intellectual goods need external incentives. Indeed, the current legal literature on intellectual property is rife with reliance on the incentive theory. It undergirds IP discourse generally. Today, as scholars weigh in about the future direction of intellectual property law, this great fallacy causes them to draw erroneous conclusions and to champion ill-considered changes in the law. \n\n*  Not Confusing the Exceptions with the Rule. There are undoubtedly exceptions. Valuable intellectual assets whose development almost certainly required the incentive of external rewards, such as those made possible by intellectual property rights, include virtually all large-budget major motion pictures,  virtually all large-budget television series, and many or most new  pharmaceutical compounds. The exceptions to the general rule of spontaneous creative labor, however, do not disprove the rule. Why not? The exceptions arise out  of the costs of production and distribution of creative and innovative labors, not the creative labor per se. \n\n* Sunsetting Intellectual Property Entitlements. Much of intellectual property law may ultimately be justifiable; that is, it may ultimately turn out, after data is gathered and carefully weighed, that a persuasive case can be made to justify wide swaths of entitlement-granting IP law. But, by the same token, most of intellectual property law is currently unjustified; that is, no such persuasive case has been presently put forth.  The legal doctrines of patent and copyright law—in the manifold kinds of works to which they are applied and the many forms of industry in which they inhere—exist almost wholly without a careful case having been laid for their existence. In light of that, the overall prescription is that intellectual property law, in general, should be sunsetted.\n\n* The economic centerpiece in the conventional wisdom justifying intellectual property law is a longstanding blunder. There is no broad necessity for incentives for intellectual labor. As a general matter, innovative and creative activity will thrive without artificial support.','http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1746343','http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1746343',0,0,0,'This report comprises a presentation of the raw data from the questionnaire survey followed by analysis and initial IP awareness measures.

It is the fifth in a series of research waves intended to generate benchmarks and time series relevant to the access and use of copyright material\nonline. It also outlines the background to the research and a detailed description of the\nmethodology employed.','* Sixty-two per cent of UK internet users aged 12+ consumed at least one item of online content (legally or illegally) over the three-month period March-May 2015. Forty-two per cent had downloaded content, and 57% had streamed or accessed content. The streaming activity has grown significantly from previous waves. This is the highest level of streaming or accessing content online we have seen to date. \n\n* Consumption varied across content types; music (35%) and TV programmes (34%) had the highest levels either downloaded or streamed online in the past three months, followed by films (22%), books (12%), computer software (12%) and video games (12%). The overall consumption level has risen from the previous wave, mainly driven by the growth in the film category.\n\n* Over half (56%) of those who consumed any type of content during the past three months, paid for at least some of it. This remains stable, with no change in paid and free consumption of content from the past wave (W4).\n\n* Just over a quarter (27%) of 12+ UK internet users accessed content entirely for free, this proportion has increased slightly from Wave 4 (25%) but not significantly.\n\n* These increases reflect slightly higher consumption levels during W5 compared to W4, and a stable proportion of 12+ UK internet users consuming a mix of paid and free content (23% in W4 and 24% in W5).\n\n* In terms of those who accessed individual content types, there was a small but significant decrease in the proportion who watched online TV programmes for free from 93% during W4, to 87% in W5. This is driven by an increase in those who paid for all content from 7% in wave 4 to 15% in wave 5.\n\n* 18% (equating to approximately 7.8 million) of UK internet users aged 12+ consumed at least one item of online content illegally over the three-month period March-May 2015. And 6% of the 12+ UK internet users have exclusively consumed illegal content. There have been no significant changes in this proportion since W4.\n\n* Levels of infringement varied significantly by content type; 9% consumed at least some music illegally over the three-month period, while 7% did so for TV programmes and 6% for films. For computer software, video games and ebooks these figures were 2%, 2% and 1%, respectively.\n\n* If instead of looking at ‘all internet users aged 12+’ we use a base of ‘all internet users who consumed content online over the three-month period’, we found that 31% consumed at least one item illegally. Furthermore, 25% of those who consumed film, and 26% of those who consumed music, did so illegally, while the lowest incidence of illegal consumption was among online book consumers (10%).\n\n* The proportion of all internet users aged 12+ who consumed content exclusively legally  has decreased slightly for this wave from W4 from 40% in W4 to 39% in W5','* The top three factors that infringers said would encourage them to stop included the availability of cheaper legal services (25%), if everything they wanted was available legally (21%), and if it was clearer what is legal and what is not (21%).

Only 14% of those who consumed illegal content exclusively stated that nothing would encourage them to stop.\n\n* Fifteen per cent of infringers indicated that they would be put off ‘if my ISP sent me a letter saying they would suspend my internet access’, falling to 11% for ‘if my ISP sent me a letter informing me my account had been used to infringe’, and 10% for ‘if my ISP sent me a letter saying they would restrict my internet speed’.','https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/449592/new_OCI_doc_290715.pdf','https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/449592/new_OCI_doc_290715.pdf',0,0,0,'The behaviour of 4552 Internet users aged 12+ in the UK has been analysed'),('Kanwar_and_Evenson_(2003)','Kanwar and Evenson (2003)','http://www.copyrightevidence.org/evidence-wiki/index.php/Kanwar_and_Evenson_(2003)',2003,'Does Intellectual Property Protection Spur Technological Change?','Of the diverse factors motivating technological change, one factor that has received increasing attention in the recent past has been the protection of intellectual property rights. Given fairly recent changes in the international policy ethos where a regime of stronger intellectual property protection has become a fait accompli for most developing countries (and the developed too), it is of some significance to ask whether more stringent protection of intellectual property does indeed encourage innovation. And this is the question which this paper examines, utilising cross‐country panel data on R&D investment, patent protection and other country‐specific characteristics spanning the period 1981–95.

To take the most common example, if a service reliant on user-generated content follows the statutory procedures, acts on notices, and otherwise lacks specific knowledge of user infringement on its site (the complicated \"red flag\" knowledge standard), it can claim safe harbor protection in the event of a lawsuit. Services can make decisions about taking down material based on substantive review and their tolerance for risk. They may also adopt technologies or practices to supplement notice and takedown, though the law makes no such demands beyond a requirement for repeat infringer policies. The resulting balance has enabled a relatively broad scope for innovation in search and user-generated-content services. As one entrepreneur put it in our recent study of these issues, notice and takedown was \"written into the DNA\" of the Internet sector. The rights holder companies are slowly winning on enforcement and the largest Internet companies have become powerful enough to fend off changes in law that could threaten their core business models.','* In the last five or six years, the practice of notice and takedown has changed dramatically, driven by the adoption of automated notice-sending systems by rights holder groups responding to sophisticated infringing sites.\n\n* For some online services, the numbers of complaints went from dozens or hundreds per year to hundreds of thousands or millions. In 2009, Google’s search service received less than 100 takedown requests. In 2014, it received 345 million requests.\n\n* As automated notices overwhelmed small legal teams, targeted services lost the ability to fully vet the complaints they received. Because companies exposed themselves to high statutory penalties if they ignored valid complaints, the safest path afforded by the DMCA was to remove all targeted material. Some companies did so. Some responded by developing automated triage procedures that prioritized high-risk notices for human review (most commonly, those sent by individuals).\n\n* The DMCA+ measures included the use of content filtering systems, such as YouTube’s ContentID and Audible Magic. They included special takedown privileges for trusted senders; expanded profiling of users; restrictive terms of service; modifications to search functionality; and other approaches that stretched beyond the DMCA’s requirements.\n\n* Smaller services sometimes ceded control of takedown to rights holder groups, in some cases via direct back-end administrative access. Larger services with more leverage sought to retain control but, in some cases, adopted blocking or content filtering systems as part of their risk assessments.\n\n* Today, for online services with significant copyright exposure, the DMCA’s procedural balance is, practically speaking, obsolete. Practices shift the balance of protection from users to rights holders, and hold out the statutory remedies as, at best, last resorts for user and services\n\n* According to smaller services surveyed, traditional DMCA compliance appears fragile—dependent on rights holder forbearance or inattention that could change at any time.\n\n* Google takes down 97.5% of requests. This percentage proved, in our surveys, to be on the low end for companies that receive large numbers of automated notices.\n\n* 1 in 25 (4.2%) of the requests sampled were fundamentally flawed—simply targeting the wrong content\n\n* One-third of requests (28.9%) had characteristics that raised concerns about the validity of the claim\n\n* Despite the resources Google invests in this process, almost none of these notices, statistically speaking, receive substantive examination.','* Automation has transformed notice and takedown from a targeted remedy for specific acts of infringement into a large-scale strategy for limiting access to infringing content.

(1990), software was also the first copyrighted product that was duplicated on a large scale. BSA defined software piracy as the illegal copying, downloading, sharing, selling or installing of copyrighted software.\nIt is difficult to measure accurately the worldwide magnitude of the software piracy problem. According to the Business Software Alliance (BSA) Global Software Piracy Report, the rate of software piracy in 2009 was 43%. This is a serious problem for the world economy, but the problem is more serious in Turkey. According to the BSA 2009 Global Software Piracy Report, the software piracy rate in Turkey was 63% in 2009.

Before advanced technology and high speed Internet, software piracy was carried out by copying disks or other types of physical objects, but now almost all types of software piracy occur over the Internet.\nThe aim of this study is to explore the factors that contribute to pirated software usage among Turkish Internet users in order to define the dynamics behind the problem of software piracy from the Internet users’ perspective. Definition of the reasons behind an existing problem is a crucial part of the problem solving process.

It further identifies systematic biases relating to the unjustified use of data published by the industry watchdog Business Software Alliance (BSA).','* The existing literature on piracy, while in general all focusing on piracy in the music, software or film industries, is disparate and not robust in its findings.\n* Too often the research assumes that actions of pirates and non-pirates are mutually exclusive. \n* There is too much reliance on the piracy statistics produced by the Business Software Alliance, a US industry body who are not impartial on the subject of piracy.','* Studying shifts in the perception of society towards piracy is important for policy makers in determining effective policy.\n* Piracy has complex effects on the industry and these need to be understood so as to ensure any increase in social welfare is not lost by engaging in anti-piracy measures.',NULL,'http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1747-1796.2010.00412.x/full',1,0,1,'No original data.

In this article, we trace the origins of this provision to a conceptual shift that took place during the early 1800s. Specific regulations of the book trade were superseded by the protection of all instantiations (such as performances, translations and adaptations) of abstract authored work. For two seminal copyright acts of the period, the Prussian Act of 1837 and the UK Act of 1842, we show there was considerable concern about the economic implications of this new justificatory paradigm, reflected in a period of experimentation with sophisticated registration requirements. We indicate market responses to these requirements and plea for a reconsideration of “formalities” as redressing justificatory problems of copyright in the digital environment.','After re-assessing the economic rationale for the registration requirement, registration is suggested as a policy option in the context of contemporary copyright laws under pressure from digitization.\nWe have identified some sophisticated registration systems pioneered in theearly 19th century context when a dramatic conceptual shift took place away from specific regulations of printing towards a broad protection of abstract works. Pace Berne, these registration mechanisms should be subjected to a more far-reaching welfare analysis. Digital technology may not only facilitate copying, but also allow the creation and maintenance of databases defining modes of exploitation and rights claimed. Some of the energies of the entertainment industry’s anti-piracy campaign may be fruitfully channelled into such an enterprise. \nIt may not be realistic to expect an imminent review of the international copyright regime following the integration of key parts of Berne into the TRIPS agreement of 1994 (now administered by the WTO). However, copyright enforcement in the digital environment depends on a certain level of normative consensus among its users. This could be achieved by a system of voluntary registration, specifying intended exploitation, with the aim to encourage unpredicted creative re-use of cultural materials.','Registration was part of many early copyright institutional mechanisms, initially as a permission to publish. As an economic burden, however, it was not very onerous. It involved a decision over which works warranted protection (creating some opportunity costs) and modest fees to the registrar.30 In imposing opportunity and administration costs, registration increases the public domain to all works which creators or publishers do not consider valuable enough to offset these costs. Broadly speaking, any registration requirement reduces the number of works in copyright - by how much depends on the precise structure of the system. From the patent system, we may glean that there are at least two further ways of increasing the public domain effects of registration: increasing annual fees, and claims that specify the precise nature of the rights granted.\nFrom a public policy perspective, this trade off is welcome. Protection is only granted to exploitations that are commercially valuable (and might not have occurred without protection), while future authors can make free and creative use of a larger number of cultural materials. This tallies with a widely accepted economic and political premise that access to information is central to innovation and the fabric of open societies.','http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2619272','http://eprints.bournemouth.ac.uk/1267/',0,0,0,''),('Kheria_(2012)','Kheria (2012)','http://www.copyrightevidence.org/evidence-wiki/index.php/Kheria_(2012)',2012,'Copyright and Digital Art: Through the Looking Glass','Copyright promotes creativity. Copyright hinders creativity. These statements reflect the contested nature of copyright, today more than ever before. The last twenty years have seen rapid advancements in digital technologies and information and communication systems. These advancements have had profound effects on creative activities: the process of production, dissemination, exploitation and consumption of creative output has changed; opportunities for novel ways and forms of creation, representation and manipulation of information have arisen; and, the attitudes and behaviour of creators and consumers of creative output and a host of intermediary participants in the process have transformed. As a result, copyright law has faced considerable and persistent practical challenges in adapting its contours to the digital environment. More importantly, the role of copyright, as a framework for regulating creative activities, has also come under scrutiny. \n\nWhat then is the role of copyright law in the everyday context of new and emerging creative activities -- that are borne out of the very copying and distribution technologies that have challenged copyright? How do the creative practitioners involved in such activities relate to copyright law? This chapter explores the interaction between copyright and the everyday life of artists in the digital environment. It focuses on the role of copyright in the every day context of a specific creative activity: digital art practice. It draws upon the findings from a qualitative empirical study, consisting of in-depth interviews with digital artists in the UK and Ireland, to peer ‘through the looking glass’ at the perspectives and practices of digital artists and finds ‘a messy wonderland of copyright in action’. A wonderland where: artists challenge and resist the law’s default positions and policy’s dominant presumptions, artists are informed and influenced by multiple elements and contextual factors in their process of meaning-making and decision making about copyright, and, artists face moral dilemmas and are pulled in different directions with respect to their perspectives and decisions regarding copyright.\n\nSection II of this chapter contextualizes the study and outlines the methodology employed. Section III and IV presents some of the findings from the study to demonstrate how the interviewees were challenging ownership and valuing authorship and illustrate how a variety of factors influenced the artists’ understandings around copyright. Section V provides concluding remarks.','The overarching perception amongst the interviewees was that copyright was “indifferent” to and\nnot useful for individual artists. They held very strong opinions on copyright which displayed a\ngeneral disenchantment with the purpose of copyright, as well as suspicion of copyright law,\nwhile admitting and lamenting that they may lack accurate knowledge of copyright law. Scholars\nhave argued that various types of rhetoric (copyright benefits authors, copyright exists to\nincentivize creativity, the romantic view of authorial creation, and economic analysis of\ncopyright) can be quite powerful and have been routinely used by stakeholders, other than\ncreators, to gain support for strengthening and extending intellectual property rights. The\nfindings demonstrate that the interviewees were knowledgeable of some of the critical discourse\non copyright law in the popular media and this contributed to their scepticism as to the value of\nprotection offered by copyright law to creators as well as its wider purpose. Instead of buying\ninto the rhetoric, the interviewees were questioning it.','When laws are based on instrumentalist claims without solid real-world evidence, they risk\nlosing legitimacy. An unduly restrictive copyright system which does not meet the needs of creators or consumers, who wish to copy and use works protected by copyright, can trivialise the\nlaw for them. Similarly, copyright protection, which does not meet the needs of the creators\nwhom it aims to protect, can also lead to scepticism about the law. The interviewees’ own\nmeanings and images of the law that they had internalized in their creative practice illustrates\nthat copyright law and policy in this case implied little for those whose creative practice it aimed to govern. As such, a challenge for copyright policy making is not just to increase awareness of the law and access to works for the users of the system, but to ensure that it retains the faith of those whom it primarily claims to benefit: the creators.\nThe interviewees were clearly not convinced that copyright was working for creators’ benefit.\nHowever, they did not discount that it could. For the copyright system to support creativity, it\nrequires the confidence of its stakeholders, in particular the creators who ‘must see it as appropriate, effective, fair and reasonable.’ For the copyright framework to be effective in\nsupporting new and emerging creative activities, the first step could very well be to regain\nlegitimacy and confidence about its potential role and relevance amongst digital creators.','http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2121338','http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2121338',0,0,0,'The study uses qualitative data collected from interviews with 17 digital artists.'),('Kheria_(2013)','Kheria (2013)','http://www.copyrightevidence.org/evidence-wiki/index.php/Kheria_(2013)',2013,'Copyright and Digital Art Practice: The ‘Schizophrenic’ Position of the Digital Artist','What is the role of copyright in the everyday social context of new, emerg¬ing and ‘born digital’ artistic activities? Is copyright able to govern the practical behaviour of artists and creative practitioners? If not, then what or who impacts on their behaviour? This paper focuses on the interac¬tion of copyright with the everyday life of creators working in the digital environment and discusses their ‘schizophrenic’ position. It draws upon a qualitative empirical study with digital artists aimed at exploring their perceptions of copyright law: how they understand and manage copyright and how copyright interacts with the local circumstances of their day to day creative practice. A finding of this study was that some of the artists faced moral dilemmas and were pulled in different directions with respect to their perspectives and decisions regarding copyright. The consequence of this was a seemingly ‘schizophrenic’ position, one that manifested in various ways – such as emphasize that ‘copying’ cannot and should not be controlled in the digital medium but equally feeling compelled to have some control. Other artists rejected the prevention of copying in the digital domain while relying on exclusivity of copies in the analogue domain and / or denied the applicability of traditional notions of authorship to their practice while asserting the importance of attribution.','* Copyright law was not seen to have any independent ability to incentivize or indeed govern the interviewees’ practice as an external influence. Instead, a range of ‘actors’ were found to contribute to decision-making and norm-setting in the interviewees’ practices being regulated with little recourse to formal rules of copyright.\n* While ‘copyright protection’ was one of such actors that could play a part in informing creators in their decisions on creation, dissemination and exploitation of their works, various other ‘actors’ were found to play a much more prominent role. Some of these ‘actors’ were: their attraction to the potentials and inherent capabilities of the digital medium, their understandings and meanings of the ‘digital,’ their political and ethical stance, contemporary art practices and philosophy, their academic and research backgrounds, strong intrinsic motivations, lack of knowledge of the law as well as their legal consciousness.\n* Strong intrinsic motivations also played an important role in shaping their practice. The interviewees communicated that the motivation behind their creative practice was not financial gain and emphasis was placed upon the belief that it was certainly not a precondition for them to have and continue their art practice. Instead, they believed that their personal motivations of simply wanting to be involved in, and remain involved in, the creative process (for reasons such personal interest, enjoyment, ‘a compulsion to create’) was the driving force behind their practice.','* Contemporary art practices before the digital era had already raised questions concerning the legitimacy of the copyright framework and challenged notions of originality and authorship, and the scope of protection under copyright law. \n* Digital art offers a premise that both advances and exaggerates these questions because it is comprised of elements that are part ‘orig¬inal’ (the sort of originality that is exalted by copyright), and part ‘remade’ (the sort of use that is considered infringement under copyright).\n* For the copyright system to support creativity, it requires the confidence of its stakeholders, in particular the creators who ‘must see it as appropriate, effective, fair, and reasonable.’','http://ojs.gold.ac.uk/index.php/lea/article/view/52',NULL,0,0,0,'A qualitative empirical study was conducted with 21 digital artists based in the UK and Ireland.

This study found that income level, income inequality, and market size directly impact music piracy, whereas income level, level of education, music CD price, and market size influenced music piracy through intellectual property protection.','- The results show that GDP per capita, income inequality, intellectual property protection, and music market size play a significant role in predicting music piracy rates across countries.\n\n- Music market size is significantly associated with music piracy rates, suggesting that countries with bigger music markets have lower music piracy rates than those with smaller markets.This study supports previous findings from software piracy studies that found that countries with larger domestic software industries had a lower incidence of piracy (Gopal& Sanders,1998).\n\n- Countries with higher education levels are relatively less strict on intellectual property protection. This may imply that people with higher education may have greater moral and ethical standards against music piracy.\n\n- In the current study, unlike earlier research that suggested that individualism–collectivism was an influential factor onmusic piracy rates, such effect on music piracy was not supported.','In considering the impact of music market size on music piracy, the music industry should use a more proactive marketing strategy.

This may be employed as an initial strategy to encourage the market to maturate in a country where levels of music piracy are relatively high.\nTo reduce illegal copying, buying, and selling of music Cds in the long term, an expansion of the music market can be more effective than lawsuits against consumers or developing technology to prevent unauthorized duplication.','http://facultynh.syr.edu/bjsheeha/Research%20Projects/music%20download%20research/music%20download%20project/articles%20for%20music%20download/global%20privacy.pdf','http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1460-2466.2006.00026.x/abstract',1,0,1,'The data pertaining to music piracy rates across countries used in this study were provided by the IFPI.

These are likely to range from works with high commercial value, such as fine art and commercial films with attributable artists and/or rights holders and collecting societies, to works of low commercial value but high academic, cultural and historic worth, such as documentary photographs, letters and sound recordings, where a recognised rights holder is unlikely.','1)The average proportion of Orphan Works in collections across the UK’s public sector was measured at 5% to 10%, whilst in certain sectors (archives) this proportion was higher.\n\n2)The mid-range estimates put the total number of Orphan Works, represented in our sample of 503 responses to the online survey, at a total of in excess of 13 million.\n\n3)Individual estimates suggest that there are single organisations in the survey sample that hold in excess of 7.5 million Orphan Works. If we include even a few of these extreme examples in our calculations, it appears likely that this sample of 503 organisations could represent volumes of Orphan Works well in excess of 50 million.\n\n4)Extrapolated across UK museums and galleries, the number of Orphan Works can conservatively be estimated at 25 million, although this figure is likely to be much higher.\n\n5)The extent of Orphan Works across the public sector and their potential impact is huge. On average, 89% of participants’ service delivery is at least occasionally affected, whilst 26% noted that the issue of Orphan Works either frequently affects them or affects everything that they do.\n\n6)The types of works likely to be Orphan Works are those with little commercial value, but high academic and cultural significance and where rights holders, if traced, would usually be happy for their works to be reproduced. User generated content, works by amateur or local artists and works by artists using aliases were also mentioned as at risk of being Orphan Works.\n\n7)A number of factors were identified as leading to Orphan Works, including: \n−− Insufficient information identifying the copyright owner\n−− The owner of the copyright could not be located\n−− The copyright holder has died and there is no further information about ownership of the rights\n\n8)Overall, the most common method for managing Orphan Works is the adoption of a risk managed approach (average of 60%), whilst 4% of respondents gave ‘other reasons’. Differences in how organisations might handle Orphan Works occur between sectors.\n\n9)Organisations spent on average less than half of one day tracing rights for each Orphan Work. Therefore it would take in the region of 6 million days effort to trace the rights holders for the 13 million works represented in our on-line survey. In certain high profile projects, some organisations had spent large resources of time on chasing rights holders. However time and additional resources are also being used to educate the public and students and train (and remind) colleagues about the specifications of working with Orphan Works.\n\n10)At least 35% of organisations across all sectors, regardless of the size of their collections, do not have any specific resources in place to help deal with Orphan Works. It should be noted that responses from non-UK based respondents broadly corroborated the findings across sectoral divides, apart from how organisations handle Orphan Works, which varied between the UK and the international responses.','The scale and impact of Orphan Works across the public sector confirms that the presence of Orphan Works is in essence locking up culture and other public sector content and preventing organisations from serving the public interest. Works of little and/or variable commercial value but high academic and cultural significance are languishing unused. Access to an immense amount of this material, essential for education and scholarship, is consequently badly constrained, whilst scarce public sector resources are being used up on complex and unreliable ‘due diligence’ compliance. Without any kind of UK or European Union-wide legal certainty, there will remain a major risk for all users of Orphan Works. The quantity of Orphan Works and their impact is only accelerating as content is being created and digitised without adherence to any single internationally recognised standard for capturing provenance information.\nThe data and anecdotal feedback suggests that many public sector organisations are themselves unsure as to the extent of the problem, and that staff awareness and understanding are often limited.\n\nThere are also suggestions that often works are selected for digitisation based on the fact that they do not pose any copyright issues, thus creating a black hole of 20th century content. These issues stress the need for an informed and skilled public sector to deal with all the issues associated with copyright-related materials, the necessity for access to resources to deal with Orphan Works, and an informed and proportionate understanding of the nature of the risks associated with the use of these works.\n\nIt is crucial that policy makers recognise the problems that public sector bodies face in managing and providing public access online to a vast range of works in copyright (including Orphan Works), and create a suite of appropriate legislatively based solutions. Whether the answer is a UK or an international one, involving a change in practice and interpretation and/or a change in legislation, this is clearly a matter of urgency. Without these legal safeguards, the contribution of public sector content to a global digital landscape will continue to be severely curtailed and the levels of public resources to manage copyright will be unacceptable.','http://www.webarchive.org.uk/wayback/archive/20140615221324/http://www.jisc.ac.uk/media/documents/publications/infromthecoldv1.pdf','http://www.webarchive.org.uk/wayback/archive/20140615221324/http://www.jisc.ac.uk/media/documents/publications/infromthecoldv1.pdf',0,0,0,'The study uses evidence gathered by two organisations: the Collections Trust and the Strategic Content Alliance.

(2) From a user perspective purchases of protected material may take the form of a licensing contract, governing behaviour after the initial transaction.\nThus, a review of the relationship between copyright and contract law has to address both supply- and demand-side issues. On the supply side, policy concerns include whether copyright law delivers the often stated aim of securing the financial independence of creators. Particularly acute are the complaints by both creators and producers that they fail to benefit from the exponential increase in the availability of copyright materials on the Internet. On the demand side, the issue of copyright exceptions and their policy justification has become central to a number of reviews and consultations dealing with digital content.

Drawing on economic and socio-psychological notions of ‘network’, increasing returns and social contagion effects are distinguished. Increasing returns may govern the adoption of standards when choices are binary, social contagion explains the diffusion of cultural goods when choices are multiple. Together, the four structural features delineating cultural industries account for curious competitive dynamics prevalent in cultural markets, such as the notorious 10 : 90 proportionality (under which 10% of cultural goods account for 90% of the market), causal ambiguity about the reasons for success, and the formation of fashions. Six managerial recommendations are advanced, focusing on a criticial circulation point triggering self-sustaining diffusion patterns. Finally ‘project-based enterprises’ and ‘network forms of governance’ are identified as the organizational forms most suited to the dynamics of the cultural markets.','* In order to benefit from social contagion and increasing returns, goods in cultural industries have to reach a critical mass of circulation. \n* The managerial recommendations researchers derived from the structural features of the cultural industries are consistent with organizational forms favoring rapid responses in a climate of competition. \n* Analysis suggests that ‘critical mass management’ relies heavily on the integration of social structure in at least two ways (1) cultural industries draw from a pool of professionals that is not organized as a market; and (2) cultural industries are organized around ‘boundary spanning’ contacts who have the ability to cross social networks. \n* Analysis suggests that cultural exchange conditions favor a particular form of network governance.',NULL,NULL,'http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/1467-8551.10.s1.6/abstract',0,0,0,''),('Kretschmer,_Klimis,_and_Wallis_(2001)','Kretschmer, Klimis, and Wallis (2001)','http://www.copyrightevidence.org/evidence-wiki/index.php/Kretschmer,_Klimis,_and_Wallis_(2001)',2001,'Music in Electronic Markets An Empirical Study','Music plays an important, and sometimes overlooked part in the transformation of communication and distribution channels. With a global market volume exceeding $40 billion, music is not only one of the primary entertainment goods in its own right. Since music is easily personalised and transmitted, it also permeates many other\nservices across cultural borders, anticipating social and economic trends. This article presents one of the first detailed empirical studies on the impact of Internet technologies on a specific industry. Drawing on more than 100 interviews conducted between 1996 and 2000 with multinational and independent music companies in 10 markets, strategies of the major players, current business models, future scenarios and regulatory responses to the on-line distribution of music files are identified and evaluated. The data suggest that changes in the music industry will indeed be far-reaching, but disintermediation is not the likely outcome.','* Multinational companies may be distinguished as the main provider of risk finance in winner-take-all markets and by their control of a capital intensive global marketing and distribution operation.\n\n* How will digital communication and distribution technologies affect the structure of the music industry? Given the current oligopolistic order, it is unsurprising that our 15 interviews revealed a concerted effort by multinational companies to delay and control the impact of the Internet. Rather than engaging with the development of new business models for e-commerce, the multinationals showed a defensive orientation.\n\n* Interviews at all multinationals indicated that they would ‘follow demand, not be proactive’ (CFO, multinational). Priority was given to protecting existing margins and relationships with retailers. Multinationals generally refuse to licence their catalogue to third parties, offering on-line distribution.\n\n* Despite a defensive orientation, the established music industry is unlikely to succeed in stemming the digital tide. Scenario techniques open a way to conceptualise a multichannel future beyond on-line distribution. Over two axis’, supply and demand constraints for a future music industry were constructed. On the demand side, the consumers will either opt for high interactivity and a large range of choice, or less interactivity and more trusted suppliers of packages. On the supply side, the options are either a centralisation of content in the form of intellectual property rights (IPRs) controlled by few players, or decentralisation with IPR creators retaining ownership.\n\n* The music industry is entering a period of instability, which is not primarily characterised by disintermediation but changing patterns of intermeditiation. The main strategic challenge to the established players appears to be that, as yet, no credible business model has emerged in the on line environment that would secure revenue streams from value-adding intermediation and, eventually, channel investments back into content production. It is conceivable that consumers are not prepared to pay for content on the Internet as they were in retail stores.','* As the global markets become more integrated and transparent, and better copyright monitoring technologies become available, the current ways of administering copyright are under threat. Venture capitalists are entering the market (e.g. with the No. 3 US-society SESAC) ‘guided by a general feeling that rights are becoming more important, and that the established players will find it hard to adapt to the changing market and technologies’ (President, Collecting Society). In many lucrative areas (mechanical reproduction; broadcasting), multinational right holders are now in a technological position to monitor music usage and collect royalties themselves, rather than assigning rights to a collecting society. We recommend to clarify the role of collecting intermediaries (copyright societies) by European regulation.\n\n*  For a creative and innovative society, access to ideas is as important as protection. Grass-root performance activities (clubs, pubs)and informal distribution networks (cassettes, fancines, internet communities, MP3 sites, local radio) appear to be an effective basis for a national music industry.

As Thomas Babington (Lord) Macaulay argued in a famous speech on copyright reform in the House of Commons (5 February 1841): “…there are only two ways in which (men of letters) can be remunerated. One of those is patronage; the other is copyright.”\nIn a continuous line of reasoning, the thought persisted into the recitals of current European legislation. The 2001 Information Society Directive (2001/29/EC) is introduced thus: “If authors or performers are to continue their creative and artistic work, they have to receive appropriate reward for the use of their work…” (Recital 10). “A rigorous, effective system for the protection of copyright and related rights is one of the main ways of ensuring that European cultural creativity and production receive the necessary resources and of safeguarding the independence and dignity of artistic creators and performers” (Recital 11).\nThis study shows quite conclusively that current copyright law has empirically failed to meet these aims. The rewards to best-selling writers are indeed high but as a profession, writing has remained resolutely unprosperous.','* In 2004-05, professional UK authors (defined for the purposes of this study as those who allocate more than 50% of their time to writing) earned a median (‘typical’) wage of £12,330 (=64% of the national gross median wage). In 2005, professional German authors earned a median wage of €12,000/£8,280 (=42% of the national net median wage).\n\n* Compared to the UK, writers’ earnings are lower and less skewed in Germany. This may reflect a more regulated environment for copyright contracts in Germany. It may also reflect the globalised nature of English language markets. Income that reflects actual use of copyright works is most skewed.\n\n* Female writers earn considerably less than male writers. The greatest gap is for main-income writers (those who earn at least 50% of their income from writing): UK female main-income writers earn 59% of male average (mean) earnings; German female main-income writers earn 69.5% of male average (mean) earnings.\n\n* Increased exploitation and use of copyright works through the Internet has not translated into increased earnings of writers. Only 14.7% of professional UK writers and 9.2% of German writers have received specific payments for Internet uses of their works. The typical earnings of authors have deteriorated since 2000, both in the UK and Germany.','The authors claim that, after this study, copyright policy cannot remain the same.

Levy schemes exist now in 22 out of 27 Member States (with only the UK, Ireland, Malta, Cyprus and Luxembourg remaining outside). Despite their wide adoption, levy systems are little understood, both in respect of their rationale and their economic consequences. Tariffs are increasingly contested in  court, leading to a large gap between claimed and collected revenues. The European Commission has announced “comprehensive legislative action” for 2012. \nThis report offers the first independent empirical assessment of the European levy system as a whole. The research consolidates the evidence on levy setting, collection and distribution; reviews the scope of consumer permissions associated with levy payments; and reports the results of three product level studies (printer/scanners, portable music/video/game devices, and tablet computers), analysing the relationship between VAT, levy tariffs and retail prices in 20 levy and  non-levy countries.','There are dramatic differences between countries in the methodology used for identifying leviable devices, setting tariffs, and allocating beneficiaries of the levy. There are levies on blank media in 22 EU countries, on MP3 players in 18 countries, on printers in 12 countries, on personal computers in 4 countries. Revenues collected per capita vary between €0.02 (Romania) and €2.6 (France). The distribution of levy revenues to recording artists is less than €0.01 per album.\nThese variations cannot be explained by an underlying concept of economic harm to rightholders from private copying.\nThe scope of consumer permissions under the statutory exceptions for private copying within the EU vary, and generally do not match with what consumers ordinarily understand as private activities.\nIn levy countries, the costs of levies as an indirect tax are not always passed on to the consumer. In competitive markets, such as those for printers, manufacturers of levied goods appear to absorb the levy. There appears to be a pan-European retail price range for many consumer devices regardless of levy schemes (with the exception of Scandinavia).\nIn non-levy countries, such as the UK, a certain amount of private copying is already priced into  retail purchases. For example, right holders have either explicitly permitted acts of format shifting, or decided not to enforce their exclusive rights. Commercial practice will not change as a result of introducing a narrowly conceived private copying exception. \nA more widely conceived exception that would cover private activities that take place in digital networks (such as downloading for personal use, or non-commercial adaptation and distribution within networks of friends) may be best understood not as an exception but as a statutory licence. Such a licence could include state regulated payments with levy characteristics as part of a wider overhaul of the copyright system, facilitating the growth of new digital services.','Reviews of the intellectual property system in the digital environment will not be successful until copyright practice meets with a minimum of acceptance. Economically and socially, minimum acceptance entails that creators are willing to create; that publishers and producers are willing to invest; and that consumers remain willing to buy (and that assumes that they understand some form of legal exclusion as justified).\nFor the UK, a key question is if new exceptions, or changes to the scope of exceptions and limitations, can be introduced without triggering the European requirement of fair compensation, and therefore an assessment of harm.49 A second question relates to the effects of European levy schemes on the Single Market, and how the UK might respond to any proposed regulation of the European copyright system. \nThere appears to be no economic case for adding another layer of licensing on copyright transactions if limited to the narrow meaning of private copying covered by the “first sale” argument. Within the constraints of EU law, the UK’s economically efficient option appears to be the de minimis argument (= no harm): a certain amount of copying in already priced into the first retail purchase. \nThe discussion of a statutory licence, or a voluntary licence under state supervision, moves beyond allocative efficiency to consumer issues (including higher norms of privacy), and the reward of creators (equity in distribution). The arguments for a levy scheme of fair compensation here are distinct, but overlap in complex ways with the justification for copyright itself.','https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/310183/ipresearch-faircomp-201110.pdf','https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/310183/ipresearch-faircomp-201110.pdf',1,0,1,'The study takes its data from several sources, including submissions from 7 of the key stakeholder collecting societies and representative bodies in the copyright industries.

An Empirical Analysis of Creators’ Earnings','Copyright matters to creators. The claim has pervaded copyright jurisprudence and economic analysis for over 200 years. Creative production would not take place without the incentive of artificial scarcity that copyright law provides. Authors and artists would starve.\n\nProfessor Breyer (as he then was) wryly remarked in The Uneasy Case (1970, at 324): “It is, of course, conceivable that some prospective Miltons have given up writing after learning that Milton’s daughter was destitute, but it is unlikely.”\n\nThis article surveys what the empirical data actually say about the way creators live. The argument proceeds in three steps.\n\nFirst, the relationship of copyright and contract law is conceptualised, starting from an analysis of contracts concluded in a pre-copyright environment (Milton 1667; Schiller 1791). The extent of statutory dependence is then scrutinised for typical sources of earnings of creators at the beginning of the 21st century.\n\nSecond, empirical evidence on creator earnings in developed cultural markets is reviewed. It is shown that the bottom 50% of composers/songwriters earn less than 5% of the total income of the population of composers/songwriters; the bottom 50% of literary authors earn under 10% of total income; the bottom 50% of visual creators earn about 10% of total income. Median incomes are close to the poverty line. The top 10% of creators receive a disproportionally large share (visual creators: 45% of total income; literary authors: 65% of total income; composers/songwriters: 80% of total income).\n\nFinally, possible interpretations of these data in the light of Landes & Posner’s “harmony of interest” assumption (An Economic Analysis of Copyright Law, 1989) are considered and rejected. Creators (authors, performers) and investors (publishers, producers) have conflicting interests, and copyright law does not harmonise but exacerbate these.\n\nThe article concludes that copyright law empirically fails to secure the financial independence of creators. If it works as an incentive for some, this may be based on a systematic cognitive mistake.','* There were 3 main themes of the paper, firstly the author started by outlining the conceptual relationship between copyright law and contracts by looking at two different types of contracts. One between an author and the publisher and the other between a footballer and the club. The author goes on to make the point that contracts between the author and publisher would exist even without copyright citing the contract between the footballer and the club as an example of that type of contract.\n* Takes a closer look into the utilitarian rationale of copyright, and suggests a shorter term copyright. \n* Secondly the author move on to contrast income of different types of creators with copyright contracts (using data from various different surveys and data sources) with income from all UK employees. The author found that the income from copyright industries was significantly less on average and far more unequal compared to income from all employment and that most artists gained large amounts of income from non-copyright sources like teaching. The author also added that artists’ income was very unstable and more creators try to embark on a career than are able to sustain them.\n* Strong competition for author and lower consumer prices was suggested as a solution to motivate creators.\n* Large number of artists make their money from non-copyright works\n* Author highlights the large gap between what the top creators, in both visual and literary markets, earn compared to the rest, continues to conclude that copyright makes this gap between distributions worse. \n* Lastly the author critiqued the “harmony of interest assumption” outlined by Landes and Posner in 1989. The author concluded that for superstar creators the market works well, they can either choose to shift risk to commercial intermediary and the publisher can also choose to share risk through a royalty contract or absorb it using a buyout. This however is not true with non-bestselling creators as they have less market power and face large amounts of competition. This conflicts with the “harmony of interests assumption” and also empirical evidence in the paper contradict the idea that copyright provides financial independence for creators partly also due to superstar affect.','Author suggests that copyright law does not matter in the context of creators earning so could be efficient to rethink the role of copyright.','http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2063735',NULL,1,0,1,'Empirical evidence from secondary sources regarding authors earnings.'),('Kretschmer_and_Harwick_(2007)','Kretschmer and Harwick (2007)','http://www.copyrightevidence.org/evidence-wiki/index.php/Kretschmer_and_Harwick_(2007)',2007,'Authors’ Earnings from Copyright and Non-Copyright Sources: A Survey of 25,000 British and German Writers','The 2001 Information Society Directive (2001/29/EC) is introduced thus: “If authors or performers are to continue their creative and artistic work, they have to receive appropriate reward for the use of their work…” (Recital 10). “A rigorous, effective system for the protection of copyright and related rights is one of the main ways of ensuring that European cultural creativity and production receive the necessary resources and of safeguarding the independence and dignity of artistic creators and performers” (Recital 11).\n\nThis study shows quite conclusively that current copyright law has empirically failed to meet these aims. The rewards to best-selling writers are indeed high but as a profession, writing has remained resolutely unprosperous. \n\nFor less than half of the 25,000 surveyed authors in Germany and the UK, writing is the main source of income. Typical earnings of professional authors are less than half of the national median wage in Germany, and one third below the national median wage in the UK. 60% of professional writers hold a second job of some kind.\n\nThroughout the study, we have attempted to differentiate between copyright and non-copyright earnings. We also have analysed for the first time systematically the distribution of income in a creative profession, calculating the Gini Coefficient for all earnings data collected (Gini=0: every writer earns the same/perfect equality; Gini=1: one earner earns everything/perfect inequality). \n\nAfter this study, copyright policy cannot remain the same. Still, for the purposes of this report, we have resisted drawing policy implications. Instead we have attempted to shape the raw data into a form that will allow multiple analyses. Emphasis has been given to providing context from statistical data held by governments, and from a comprehensive review of previous studies.','1. In 2004-05, professional UK authors (defined for the purposes of this study as those who allocate more than 50% of their time to writing) earned a median (‘typical’) wage of £12,330 (=64% of the national gross median wage). In 2005, professional German authors earned a median wage of €12,000/£8,280 (=42% of the national net median wage).\n\n2. Although authors’ earnings are well below average, the crucial distinguishing feature is the risky nature of the profession. Writers work in winner-take-all markets. The distribution of income is highly unequal, as reflected in high Gini Coefficients: The top 10% of professional writers in the UK earn about 60% of total income (they earn at least £68,200 per annum); the bottom 50% earn about 8% of total income (Gini: 0.63). In Germany, the top 10% of professional writers earn about 41% of total income (they earn at least €40,000/£27,600 per annum); the bottom 50% earn about 12% of total income (Gini: 0.52). In contrast, the national Gini Coefficient for all employees in the UK is 0.33; in Germany it is 0.31.\n\n3. Compared to the UK, writers’ earnings are lower and less skewed in Germany. This may reflect a more regulated environment for copyright contracts in Germany. It may also reflect the globalised nature of English language markets. In the UK sample, 7.2% of professional writers earned £100,000 or more from writing (mean=£188,062). In the German sample, just 1.7% of professional writers earned £100,000 (€145,000) or more. No German writers in the sample earned more than £345,000 (€500,000).\n\n4. Only 20% of UK writers earn all their income from writing. 60% of professional writers need another job to survive, both in Germany and the UK. However, UK and German writers show a distinct sociological profile. German authors are prepared to enter the market as a professional author (=allocating more than 50% of their time to writing) at a much lower median income than UK authors. UK authors also appear to have a more “establishment” background. UK writers’ households (including partners’ earnings and income from non-writing jobs) earn almost double the amount of their German counterparts (UK writers’ household mean: £55,620; German writers’ household mean: €41,644/£28,734).\n\n5. Income that reflects actual use of copyright works is most skewed. For UK professional authors, the Gini Coefficient for writing income is 0.63, for total individual income of writers it is 0.51, and for total household income of writers it is 0.47. For German professional authors, the Gini Coefficient for writing income is 0.52, for total individual income it is 0.43, and for total household income it is 0.42. The distribution of income for collecting society payments (which follows actual use) is more skewed than contractual writing income (which includes risk mitigating advances). The Gini Coefficient for ALCS (UK collecting society) payments to professional writers is 0.78; for VG Wort (German collecting society) payments it is 0.67. This suggests that current copyright law may exacerbate risk.\n\n6. Writers who bargain with their publishers/producers earn about twice as much as those who don’t (both in Germany and the UK). Compared to the UK, disputes over moral rights (the authors’ rights to be credited where their work is used and to prevent its derogatory treatment) are double as likely in Germany, reflecting perhaps the “inalienable” legal status of these rights in Germany.\n\n7. Female writers earn considerably less than male writers. The greatest gap is for main-income writers (those who earn at least 50% of their income from writing): UK female main-income writers earn 59% of male average (mean) earnings; German female main-income writers earn 69.5% of male average (mean) earnings.\n\n8. Increased exploitation and use of copyright works through the Internet has not translated into increased earnings of writers. Only 14.7% of professional UK writers and 9.2% of German writers have received specific payments for Internet uses of their works. The typical earnings of authors have deteriorated since 2000, both in the UK and Germany.','For the purposes of this report, the authors have resisted drawing policy implications.

A web resource offers transcripts and short videos of the discussion, an introductory essay, and a bibliography.

Content providers, such as media outlets and video subscription services, would like to ensure that their videos do not fail, startup quickly, and play without interruptions. In return for their investment in video stream quality, content providers expect less viewer abandonment, more viewer engagement, and a greater fraction of repeat viewers, resulting in greater revenues. The key question for a content provider or a CDN is whether and to what extent changes in video quality can cause changes in viewer behavior. Our work is the first to establish a causal relationship between video quality and viewer behavior, taking a step beyond purely correlational studies. To establish causality, we use QuasiExperimental Designs, a novel technique adapted from the medical and social sciences. We study the impact of video stream quality on viewer behavior in a scientific data-driven manner by using extensive traces from Akamai’s streaming network that include 23 million views from 6.7 million unique viewers, who watched an aggregate of 216 million minutes of 102 thousand videos over 10 days. To our knowledge, our work is the first to provide evidence that video stream quality causally impacts viewer behavior.','* Viewers start to abandon a video if it takes more than 2 seconds to start up, with each incremental delay of 1 second resulting in a 5.8% increase in the abandonment rate. \n\n* A moderate amount of interruptions can decrease the average play time of a viewer by a significant amount. A viewer who experiences a rebuffer delay equal to 1% of the video duration plays 5% less of the video in comparison to a similar viewer who experienced no rebuffering. \n\n* A viewer who experienced failure is 2.32% less likely to revisit the same site within a week than a similar viewer who did not experience a failure.','By increasing streaming quality, content providers can retain viewership and prevent viewer abandonment.

In this article we briefly review existing research on the open source phenomenon and discuss the utility of open source software research findings for many other fields. We categorize the research into three areas: motivations of open source software contributors; governance, organization, and the process of innovation in open source software projects; and competitive dynamics enforced by open source software. We introduce the articles in this special issue of Management Science on open source software, and show how each contributes insights to one or more of these areas.','Main results:\n\n*The authors propose a framework for organizing research on open source software, consisting of three areas: Motivations of Project Contributors, Governance, Organization, and the Process of Innovation, Competitive Dynamics: The Impact of Free.\n\nResearch on motivations of project contributors:\n\n*Early empirical work documented a range of motives for participation among project contributors, such as fun, enjoyment, reputation building, learning, and the private use value of the software being developed. \n\n*Theory followed, including the proposition that those who contributed code gained private benefit by signaling to prospective employers about their programming skills and thereby getting better jobs or salaries. A general argument on the private benefits that could accrue from engaging in the creation of public goods in the form of a “private-collective” model of innovation incentives is mentioned. \n\n*New research explores how motives produce a mix of outcomes, and how various motives interact to produce contributions to open source software projects. There are new insights on how firm participation, community participation, and technical design relate to the contributors’ motivations. \n\nResearch on Governance, Organization, and the Process of Innovation:\n\n*Researchers have shown interest in the challenge of governing open source software projects. Projects are based on contributions by many and sometimes thousands of volunteer developers. Volunteers can be divided into two groups: people who expect to receive rewards from contributing\nto open source software (investors), and people who do not (donators). Open source software projects may have succeeded at creating a new governance structure that reconciles the interests of people in both groups. \n\n*An emerging body of research has provided detailed accounts of open source software project organizations, highlighting a pronounced difference in roles taken by contributors.\n\n*New research shows innovation processes in open source software significantly deviate from predictions made by existing innovation theory. Case Studies and conceptual frameworks for understanding the unique character of, and the requirements for, innovation processes in open source software have been undertaken and developed.\n\nResearch on Competitive Dynamics: The Impact of Free:\n\n*Past research investigated how new technologies such as open source software can compete in an environment dominated by commercial technological standards, and a model for the impact of open source (copyleft) licensing on both the developer environment and the market for software was developed. This shows that although both commercial and open source software can coexist, scarcity of labour and product pricing must be taken into account. \n\n*Researchers also studied software firms that used open source software in delivering customized products. A framework of increasing resource allocation to open source software development showed that increased “public” investment can lead to great “private” benefits for open source–oriented firms.\n\n*New research focuses on understanding competitive dynamics. Researchers consider the mixed duopolies in which competing firms and others have heterogeneous objective functions; the technology platforms mediating competition in many industries and collaboration between firms and the open source software movement.','Policy implications:\n\n*Open source software contributors have pioneered new ideas and practices with respect to licensing of intellectual property and the organization of innovative effort. There is no reason to believe that these practices cannot spread to other areas of economic and social activity.','http://www.idi.ntnu.no/grupper/su/courses/tdt10/curricula2010/P4-3-Krogh06.pdf','http://dx.doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.1060.0560',0,0,0,'Literature review of published research on open source software.'),('Ku,_Sun,_and_Fan_(2009)','Ku, Sun, and Fan (2009)','http://www.copyrightevidence.org/evidence-wiki/index.php/Ku,_Sun,_and_Fan_(2009)',2009,'Does Copyright Law Promote Creativity?

During this time period, they monitored activity on CIWS-U near-continuously via computer. Within 3 days of when a question or an answer was posted on CIWS-U, a computer automatically detected whether the individual was posting a question (e.g. was starting a new “thread”) or was providing information related to a previously posted question (e.g. was referring to an existing thread in his or her posting). It then sent a version of a questionnaire (one appropriate to information seeking or one appropriate to information providing) to the email address of that individual. The e-mail contained a brief introduction to the study, a link to the individual’s actual posting on CIWS-U and a link to a password protected website that contained the survey.

An enduring legal question asks to what extent those other parties should be held liable for the resulting infringement. For example, should a firm that produces photocopiers be required to compensate authors for any unauthorized copies made on that firm\'s machines? What about firms that manufacture personal computers or offer Internet access; should they be held liable, at least in part, for online music piracy? In this essay, we examine how modern copyright law addresses these questions and we evaluate the resulting system on economic grounds.','All else equal, contributory liability is more attractive a) the greater the harm from direct copyright infringement; b) the less the benefit from lawful use of the indirect infringer’s product; c) the lower the costs of modifying the product in ways that cut down infringing activities without substantially interfering with legal ones; and d) the greater the extent to which indirect liability reduces the costs of copyright enforcement as compared to a system that allows only direct liability. Napster is different from a VCR manufacturer because it has low-cost ways of discouraging piracy without impinging on legitimate use. That is the core insight necessary for the design of an efficient indirect liability regime.\n\nAn efficient approach to indirect liability might start by applying a negligence rule to any activity that can lead to copyright infringement. The difference is that current law focuses on knowledge, control, the extent of any noninfringing uses and other factors without being particularly clear as to why those issues are central. An explicit negligence rule would lay bare the underlying logic of the indirect liability inquiry. One drawback to the modern implicit negligence approach is that, as applied to new technologies, it can engender considerable uncertainty. A producer responsible for a new audio recording device, for example, might find it difficult to predict what courts will require in the new setting. In response, such a producer might choose to be excessively cautious. This explains the safe harbor provision introduced by the Digital Millennium Copyright Act However, , competition in the market for Internet service provision should mitigate this problem.\n\nIn addition to negligence liability and safe harbors, an efficient indirect liability regime might also include a tailored tax applicable to particular tools, services or venues associated with copyright infringement.\n\nSometimes indirect liability should not be an option.

Such a practice not only facilitates the grassroots globalization of culture but also questions the cultural industries’ current model of global distribution. This article explores the nature and implications of fan-translation and distribution of cultural commodities through a case study of English fan-subbing of anime (subtitling of Japanese animation in English). Anime fan-subbing is situated at the disjuncture of the global mediascape, which intensifies with the increasing public access to means to copy and share, the expansion of collective knowledge and the rise of fans’ voluntary labour coordinated on a global scale. It exemplifies participatory media fandom whose globalization exceeds that of cultural industries in terms of extent and velocity. The article argues that fan-subbing, pursued as a hobby, can unsettle the global mediascape by allowing multiple mediations of cultural text and presenting a new model of content distribution and its organization based on consumers’ voluntary work.','The participatory media fandom that has resulted in fan-translation and distribution exists at a point where there is a growing contrast and disjuncture between different forces in the global mediascape: the incongruence between the ownership of copyrights of cultural products and that of technical means to copy and share; the blurred distinction between copyrighted contents and free knowledge; and gaps between the territorialized distribution of foreign cultural products and the transnationality and immediacy of consumer desire. The case study of anime fan-subbing sheds a light on the fandom’s evolving dynamics. English fan-subbing of anime was triggered by the gaps in the overseas distribution of anime and, consequently, the unmet demand of US fans. Initially, it functioned within the industry structure instead of giving birth to alternatives to the authorized products.\nThe consensus of ‘drop the project if licensed in the US (or North America)’ reflected fandom’s attempt to limit its effect to that of supplementing the local anime industry’s offer. In addition, fan-subbing’s geographical and technological constraints kept its role as a connector of missing links between the industry and viewers. However, with the arrival of digital technologies and the globalization of the fan-subbing community, fan-subbing has emerged as a new, popular model of global distribution of anime.\nThe mediation of anime text by fans is likely to lead to a surge of multiple, sometimes competing mediations of global flow of anime – by the industry as well as its consumers. Even within fansubbing itself, competing mediations are not uncommon: today we can observe multiple speed subbing groups working on the same projects, resulting in different versions of fansubs of an anime. The existence of plural mediations, within and outside the market-based system, intensifies the tension in the global mediascape by spreading multiple goals, legitimacies and operational practices of the transnational flow of cultural contents.','The anime industry exemplifies cultural industries that are facing pressure from their own consumers who, networked and coordinated on a global scale, can self-organize mediation and distribution of cultural commodities, based on the non-commercial principle. Under such pressure, the anime industry has begun framing fan-subbing as piracy. Nevertheless, the industry does not regard taking legal action as a good solution because this could alienate the fan-subbing community which has constituted the core of anime fandom. The industry’s current strategy appears to be exploring a new medium – such as the internet – for global distribution of anime, but it does not look effective at reducing the demand for fan-subbing. Like DVD distribution, authorized streaming is territorially and technologically bounded and thus still cannot subdue the immediate mediation and borderless mobility of fan-subs. In this sense, we can perhaps view a significant part of the overseas anime market as a so-called missing market: in spite of overseas fans’ growing demands for anime, a market hardly exists due to constraints such as high costs for global distribution, limited technologies (and thus limitations on visual quality as seen from authorized online streaming) and anime’s increasing assimilation to and inclusion in the free knowledge of global anime fandom. Anime’s globally dispersed missing market has been and can be explored only by the free labour of dedicated fans who have strong missions and motivations and an enthusiasm for technological innovation, and who voluntarily donate their time and skills, and can work virtually 24 hours per day collaborating with colleagues in different continents. Such a type of operation looks hard to copy and be adopted by cultural industries that work strictly within the commercial paradigm. It is yet to be observed whether or how the anime industry can come up with commercially viable models of global anime distribution that can successfully make markets out of overseas fans’ desire for anime consumption.','http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2555296','http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2555296',0,0,0,'This article uses data from a case study, which provides empirical findings from the analysis of text written by anime fans (fan forum, fans’ news sites and websites of selected fansubbing groups) and interviews conducted by the author with nine fan-subbers, an editor of a well-known anime news website, an anime historian and four industry commentators.'),('Lee_(2012)','Lee (2012)','http://www.copyrightevidence.org/evidence-wiki/index.php/Lee_(2012)',2012,'Precarious Creativity: Changing Attitudes Towards Craft and Creativity in the British Independent Television Production Sector','This article focuses on television workers’ attitudes towards craft and creative practice within the field of factual television production in the British independent  television production sector  (ITPS).

In this study, we use the release by a biotechnology company of similar software under both proprietary and open source licenses to investigate who uses open source software and why. We find that academic users are somewhat more likely to adopt open source software than private firms. We find only modest differences in the willingness of open source users to modify or improve existing programs.

More study is required. But if our results are generalizable, they have a broader implication: to bring to bear the \"law in action\" literature to the opensource-proprietary divide.

These patterns continue to hold when I employ an instrumental variables approach, which partially addresses the concern that the timing of these policy changes is not exogenous.','https://ideas.repec.org/p/nbr/nberwo/8977.html','http://www.nber.org/papers/w8977',0,0,0,'In total, I ended up with 177 events in 51 out of the 60 nations in the sample.

The research investigates two specific strategies that the recording industry has used: (1) fear or threat appeals (e.g., the threat of punishment, such as fines and/or jail time), and (2) attribution of harm (informing consumers of the harm caused by the illegal downloading of music, such as financial loss to either the artist or the recording company). The study also considers whether past illegal downloading behaviour reduces the effectiveness of these disincentive strategies. Finally, the impact of subjective norms (i.e., whether subjects think their friends would approve of downloading music) was also investigated.\n\n*Findings indicate a significant effect of threat appeal such that stronger threat appeals were found to be more effective than weaker threat appeals in reducing illegal downloading. The first study also showed that prior illegal downloading behavior does not curtail the effects of threat appeals aimed at reducing illegal downloading. In addition, results reveal no differences in downloading behavior in terms of attribution of harm deterrent strategy (harm to either the recording artist or company). The most interesting finding from the second study is that subjective norms appear to equalize low versus high past downloaders, but only under conditions of weak fear.\n\n*The current manuscript is the first to examine the impact of four different variables (threat appeals, attribution of harm, subjective norms, and previous downloadingbehavior) on subjects’ likelihood to illegally download music in the future. In particular, this research illuminates the potential importance of social norms in discouraging a type of undesirable consumer behavior but shows that this occurs only under a restricted set of conditions: when threat is low and the consumer is not a habitually high downloader. It should be of interest to those in fields where intellectual property can be pirated on the Internet.','The main results of the study: \n\n*The results of the two studies indicate that stronger threat appeals lessened the likelihood that students will download music in the future, and students who have downloaded many songs in the past are more likely to download in the future. \n\n*Contrary to our predictions, we found that attribution of harm had no impact on students’ intentions to download in the future. It is quite possible that college students, who are typically not yet financially independent, have a hard time believing that music artists and/or companies truly need the money that is lost due to downloading music. \n\n*The most interesting finding from study two was that social norms have a significant impact on future downloading behavior. In other words, college students do care what others think about them downloading songs without paying.\n\n*In particular, this research illuminates the potential importance of social norms in discouraging a type of undesirable consumer behavior but shows that this occurs only under a restricted set of conditions: when threat is low and the consumer is not a habitually high downloader.\n\n*For these consumers, the extra incentive of doing what others think is ‘cool’ compensates for low levels of threat but not for higher levels of threat. Current theories concerning the role of social norms in curbing undesirable forms of consumer behavior must consider the moderating role of factors like past behavioral patterns.','Policy implications of the study: \n\n*The results of these two studies have clear implications for marketers of electronic media (music, and possibly movies) who wish to dissuade consumers from pirating their material on the Internet. \n\n*The use of severe threats seems to be an effective way to diminish the likelihood of downloading, while attributing financial harm to either the company or artist was not found to be particularly effective. \n\n*In addition, music/movie companies might make better use of their de-marketing efforts by focusing their message on consumers who have already tried illegal downloading, but are not yet ‘habitual’ downloaders.\n\n*The use of social norms as a disincentive to download music may be particularly effective for certain consumers. \n\n*Additional research on high school students would be useful to detect when and to what extent the ‘cool’ factor impacts young consumers’ likelihood to illegally download music and/or movies.','http://www.researchgate.net/profile/Mary_Conway_Dato-on/publication/229904728_Deterring_illegal_downloading_the_effects_of_threat_appeals_past_behavior_subjective_norms_and_attributions_of_harm/links/53f510480cf2888a749174a0.pdf','http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cb.211/abstract',0,0,0,'A 3 (level of threat: low, moderate, or high) X 2 (who is harmed by illegal downloading:artist or recording company) experimental design was employed for study one. 388 undergraduates in business classes at a medium-sized south-eastern university took part.

In addition to applying the theory of planned behavior (TPB) perspective to capture behavioral intention to use pirated software, this paper considers perceived risk as a salient belief influencing attitude and intention toward using pirated software. Four perceived risk components related to the use of pirated software (performance, social, prosecution and psychological risks) have been identified, measured and tested. Data were collected through an online survey of 305 participants. The results indicate that perceived prosecution risk has an impact on intention to use pirated software, and perceived psychological risk is a strong predictor of attitude toward using pirated software. In addition, attitude and perceived behavior control contribute significantly to the intended use of pirated software. However, the proposed direct relationship between subjective norm and intention to use pirated software is not supported. Implications for research and practice are discussed.','* Attitude and perceived behavioral control are significant antecedents of intention, but subjective norm is not a significant predictor of intention.\n\n* Therefore, an individual’s intention to use pirated software does not seem to be positively affected by the approval of significant others.\n\n* Perceived social risk is not a significant predictor of attitude and of intention toward using pirated software.

BSA emphasized that ‘‘software piracy negatively affects much more than just the industry. It also puts a strain on technology companies’ ability to invest in new jobs and new technologies; harms local retailers and services firms; lowers government tax revenues; and increases the risk of cyber crime and security problems.’’ Software piracy, therefore, continues to be a major challenge for economies throughout the world.

This paper attempts to empirically examine whether file-sharing has caused the decline in record sales. It examines the size and pattern of file-sharing and its theoretical impact on record sales.

I should note that file-sharing can have a strong negative impact on sales even when a majority of downloads do not replace a sale. I am unaware of any serious analyst who has ever claimed a 1:1 relationship between an unauthorized copy and a lost sale, whether we are talking about photocopying or whether we are examining file-sharing. There are several estimates that the number of music files exchanged on file-sharing networks is larger than the number purchased through legitimate channels. If so, file-sharing could cause a ma jor loss of sales even if only a relatively small percentage. of unauthorized downloads translated into a lost sale. Nevertheless, estimates of the number of music\nfiles downloaded in file-sharing networks vary widely. In this paper I examine the different empirical methodologies that have been chosen in attempts to shed some light on this issue. These studies generally take different approaches in terms of their data analysis. The studies consistently find that file-sharing has led to a serious decline in record sales, except for one highly publicized study that reaches very different, and in my opinion, highly implausible conclusions.','* The theory underlying the analysis of file-sharing has not received the attention it deserved. It has always been clear that some possible aspects of file-sharing would harm copyright owners, such as the substitution of copies for the purchase of originals. \n* What has not been understood is that the use of file-sharing to sample products is also likely to lead to harm to copyright owners. Theoretical conditions under which file-sharing might be beneficial to copyright holders seem farfetched. \n* A broad analysis of the various theoretical factors at work supports a view that file-sharing is likely to cause serious damage to the owners of copyright materials that are shared. \n* Empirical examinations need to meet a higher hurdle than normal before they might be considered to over tern the expectation that the birth of file sharing leads to the subsequent decline in CD sales. \n* The political arena is impatient in its search for an answer and for academics to reach unanimity.

Previous copying technologies have mostly failed to live up to the extravagant predictions of harm that arose with those new technologies although precise measurements of copying\'s impact was rarely accomplished or attempted. One impediment to measuring the impact of copying with prior technologies was the difficulty of measuring copying activity. File-sharing is the newest technology for making copies and carries with it the possibility of more precise measurement of copying than has been possible in the past. This paper examines the measurement of file-sharing activity, the theory of file-sharing\'s likely impact, and the impact of file-sharing. Analysis of various data sets indicate that they do not yet live up to their hoped for precision. Data limitations not withstanding, the evidence seems compelling that file-sharing is responsible for the recent large decline in CD sales for which it has been blamed.','- Given the flawed setup of recent surveys, it is likely that the impact of file-sharing is larger than what has been reported.\n\n- The pattern of file-sharing’s birth and rapid growth followed immediately by the unusually large decline in the sound recording market supports a claim that file-sharing is responsible for the decline in sales. Add to this the predictions of economic theory that file-sharing should lead to a decline in sales and we have what appears to be a very strong case that file-sharing is the cause of the decline.\n\n- Overall, the evidence appears to be that the lawsuits had an initial negative impact on files-haring, as hoped by the RIAA, but after this initial decline the impact of the lawsuits appears to be wearing off.','- Economists are often merely consumers of data but particularly in markets that are new, or where data vendors have not yet created and demonstrated the value of their methodologies, we need to heed the caveat emptor warning before we accept the numbers that we are all so eager to put to use.','http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=646943',NULL,0,0,0,'Data are taken from various reports and compared against each other to test conclusions.'),('Liebowitz_(2008)','Liebowitz (2008)','http://www.copyrightevidence.org/evidence-wiki/index.php/Liebowitz_(2008)',2008,'Testing file sharing\'s impact on music album sales in cities','Although previous forms of copying have been found to often have benign effects on copyright owners the rise in file-sharing has coincided with a steep decline in the sale of sound recordings.

Then Napster arrived in the second half of 1999 and grew to be an international sensation during 2000. The sound recording industry in the US and throughout the world experienced a dramatic swoon in sales beginning in 2000, continuing unabated through 2010. The industry has blamed this sales decline on the growth of file-sharing. Although Napster was effectively shut down as an unauthorized file-sharing service within two years of its birth, its progeny live on, as do new habits of downloading developed by Internet users. Although it is clear that pirated versions of products often substitute for the purchase of an original, and this effect is unambiguously harmful to the industry, there are other, more subtle effects possibly at work, as well. One factor that has received a good deal of attention is the ‘sampling’ effect.

The classic moral panic literature overemphasizes control, power and hegemony while overlooking counter-discourses. This study, on the other hand, takes such forms of symbolic resistance into account. It relies on a comparative discursive network analysis of texts produced by corporate news organizations and of blogs representing pro-piracy perspectives. It is concluded that with the blurring of the boundaries between producers and consumers of content, more and more localized moral panics that are not necessarily hegemonic are likely to be seen.

It has been further contended that lower copyright protection would benefit the society as a whole, as long as authors continue to receive sufficient incentives from alternative revenue streams in any ancillary markets, e.g. touring, advertising and merchandizing. By evaluating the empirical evidence from the music, performance and videogame markets, this article highlights a counterintuitive yet important point: Copyright piracy, while decreasing the deadweight loss in the music market, could simultaneously increase the deadweight loss in ancillary markets via the interaction between complementary goods. The deadweight loss in ancillary markets tends to become dominant if a substantial portion of relevant consumers have high valuation but low frequency in music consumption, are risk averse towards upfront payment with uncertain demand, and/or discount future value at a high rate. Additionally, the findings shed new lights on the current debates on several competing propositions to reform indirect copyright liabilities in the digital.','*The author hypothesises that due to increased file sharing artists cannot recoup their investment from sales of their work so they need to turn to alternative sources of income like derivative goods and merchandise.\n\n* The author extends the idea that this causes a deadweight loss in the performance and other derivative markets because the artists need to price concert tickets higher than before in order to recoup losses from making the album for example.\n\n* Thus, according to the author, piracy in the music industry could decrease deadweight loss in the song market but increase it in derivative markets. \n\nThe author focused on 4 areas\n1.

This ruling was made against the backdrop of widespread patent holdup where patent owners used the threat of injunctive relief to extract royalties grossly disproportionate to the value of the patented feature to the whole product. The holdup problem, however, is not equally obvious in copyright law. \n\nA close examination of the copyright cases cited in eBay reveals that they are hardly compelling authorities with respect to copyright injunction. The history of copyright law appears to suggest that injunctive relief was routinely available to copyright owners who had succeeded on the merits. More remarkably, empirical evidence shows that the majority of post-eBay decisions on copyright injunctions have totally ignored the eBay decision as well as the four-factor test advocated therein. Even among the cases that did cite eBay, most courts were reluctant to withhold injunctive relief upon a finding of copyright infringement. \n\nThis Article argues that the traditional practice of copyright law and the apparent indifference toward the eBay decision may have resulted from rational choices of judges. Copyright holdup is much less pervasive than patent holdup, as interchangeable copyrighted works abound in the marketplace, and copyright law contains built-in mechanisms to control the holdup problem. Copyright injunctions also involve a distinct set of policy concerns, such as reputational harm, fair use, statutory damages, and freedom of speech. Hence, this Article proposes several approaches to reconcile the unique concerns in copyright law and the four-factor test mandated by eBay, with a focus on three scenarios that are particularly susceptible to the holdup problem.','This Article examines how much the eBay decision has guided, and should guide, copyright cases and it argues that the historical practice of copyright law and the apparent indifference toward the eBay decision may have resulted from rational choices of the judges. More specifically, it argues that: \n\n* Contrary to recent media outcries about “copyright trolls,” the holdup problem envisaged in eBay is likely to be much less pervasive under copyright law than under patent law.\n\n* Nevertheless, copyright holdup may still arise in a limited number of cases that involve innocent infringement, substantial redesign costs, and small value of a copyrighted component relative to the overall product.\n\n* The eBay decision was neither rooted in the well-established practice of copyright law nor effective in altering the adjudication of subsequent copyright injunctions.\n\n* While the eBay decision promoted a nuanced, case-by-case approach to handling motions for injunctive relief, it might just be teaching a lesson against a general rule that a patent doctrine would automatically work for copyright law.','The seeming indifference toward the eBay decision may actually result from rational choices of lower courts because the holdup problem in copyright law is much less ubiquitous and involves a different set of policy concerns.',NULL,'http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1869390',0,0,0,'The empirical part of this study is based on all reported copyright-injunction decisions during the period from May 15, 2006 (the issuing date of the eBay decision) to June 1, 2010.

However, there has been little clarity in copyright literature on how artists actually respond to copyright incentives: What factors motivate artists to create works? How do artists perceive the usefulness of copyright protection? Would artists continue their artistic careers in a world without copyright law? This article contains a systematic study regarding copyright incentives, based on industrial statistics and extensive interviews from the music industry in China, a virtual copyright-free environment featuring one of the highest piracy rates in the world and having forced dramatic transformation of music businesses.\n\nThe empirical research indicates three seemingly paradoxical phenomena: While 17.9% of all the musicians in the sample referred to economic benefits as at least part of their motivations for music creation, 97.4% specifically recognized money as being important and helpful for music creation; While 56.4% alleged that copyright piracy did not affect their creative motivations, 72% agreed that copyright piracy does affect music creation; While 53.8% explicitly admitted that they had little awareness or knowledge of copyright, 92.3% indicated that the current level of copyright protection is insufficient and 71.8% suggested that copyright law should provide strong incentives for music creation.\n\nThe empirical evidence itself provides compelling explanations for such paradoxes: Even though musicians primarily create music for music’s sake, copyright law could still supply powerful incentive for music production in a way that not only caters to market demand, but also allows for broader artistic freedom. Copyright piracy that does not necessarily affect musicians’ intrinsic motivations could nevertheless affect music creation in terms of the time spent on music creation, the volume of investment in music creation, and ultimately the quality of music creation. Most importantly, copyright incentives do not function as a reward that musicians consciously bargain for and chase after but as a mechanism that preserves market conditions for gifted musicians to prosper, including a decent standard of living, sufficient income to cover production costs, and maximum artistic autonomy during the creative process.','Given that the majority of musicians appear to create music simply for music’s sake, copyright law may not realize its full potential in the digital age if it is understood narrowly as a quid pro quo using economic benefits to induce creative production.

Rather, they seek a copyright regime that maximizes their own welfare, whatever that may be.As a result, whatever data is available, and whatever uncertainty or ambiguity remains, they will twist in order to ensure that copyright serves them, rather than society as a whole. Whether due to the first problem or the second, there are also surprisingly few empirical studies of the costs and benefits associated with broadening or narrowing copyright. This study aims to help fill that gap by examining how file sharing has affected the creation and dissemination of new original\nmusic.','In this paper, empirical evidence shows that file sharing did not reduce the creation of new hit songs. Even if we assume that file sharing caused the decline in record sales which paralleled file sharing’s rise, the decline in record sales had two effects relevant to the creation of new music. First, it shifted output along the music-other margin and led to fewer new artists, as some individuals, given the lower returns available in music, decided to devote their time and creativity elsewhere. Second, it shifted output along the work-leisure margin and led to more new music from existing artists, as the lower returns led existing artists to substitute work for leisure. Because the second marginal effect outweighed the first, file sharing, even assuming that it caused the decline in record sales, led to the creation, on balance, of more new hit songs.','Given  that  file  sharing  advances  copyright’s purported  objectives, there would seem to be only one reasonable answer as to whether file sharing, at least with respect to music, should be legal under copyright law.','http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2372630',NULL,0,0,0,'The author created a hand-coded data set identifying each new artist and each new song that appeared in the top fifty of the Billboard Hot 100 during the first week of each month from 1985 through 2013.'),('Luo_and_Mortimer_(2016)','Luo and Mortimer (2016)','http://www.copyrightevidence.org/evidence-wiki/index.php/Luo_and_Mortimer_(2016)',2016,'Copyright Enforcement: Evidence from Two Field Experiments',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,0,0,0,''),('Lu_(2009)','Lu (2009)','http://www.copyrightevidence.org/evidence-wiki/index.php/Lu_(2009)',2009,'Chinese culture and software copyright','This article explores the impacts of Chinese culture on users’ attitudes and intentions about software copyright and piracy. The findings reject the pervasive position that Chinese culture resists software copyright and encourages piracy behaviors. Instead, the study reports that Chinese culture has no significant impact on users’ intentions to use pirated software programs. Meanwhile, collectivistic and individualistic cultural components are found to coexist in the Chinese value system. The users with higher scores in the collectivistic component have more negative attitudes towards software companies, while the users with higher scores in the individualistic component have less negative attitudes towards software products. The coexistence of individualistic and collectivistic components prevents software users from falling into either direction of supporting or opposing software copyright and calls for a balanced account between software owners and users.','* The non-significant contribution of cultural factors to users’ intentions offers no evidence that Chinese culture encourages piracy behaviors\n\n*Chinese culture has varied impacts over users’ attitudes towards software copyright rather than a simplified tendency to resist software copyright.\n\n*In terms of software copyright, if Chinese culture is compared with western cultures, it is often found that Chinese collectivist culture is positively correlated with its high piracy rate (Husted, 2000; Marron and Steel, 2000). This provides the grounds for the argument that Chinese culture resists software copyright and encourages piracy.

The purpose of this research is to examine the present state of downloading and how ethical orientation and attitudes towards MP3 piracy impact such activities. This paper also aims to use ethical scenarios as a way of understanding the ethical reasoning in illegal downloading.\n\nDesign/methodology/approach – Key research questions are proposed that are related to illegal downloading. A sample of 364 university students was used to examine each research question. Statistical results are reported.\n\nFindings – The results clearly show that downloading continues at a high rate today driven by strong belief that it is not ethically wrong. Ethical orientation was found to be positively associated with awareness of the social cost of downloading, consequences of downloading, and ethical belief in downloading. Ethical scenarios show that ethical orientation is also associated with downloading activities and with stealing. Other results indicate that respondents believe that their peers are more prone to stealing music and downloading MP3s illegally. Fear of consequences does seem to have an impact on the propensity to download illegally.\n\nPractical Implications – The paper contributes to inform industry representatives that appeal to ethic or guilt are not likely to deter illegal downloading measurably. The use of punishment for downloaders may have a short-term effect but other (more positive) measures are required.\n\nOriginality/value – No research has examined downloading MP3s in the manner developed in this paper. The paper contributes to a better understanding of consumer behavior among those who download. The results provide insight into a serious problem in the recording industry that is likely to persist in the distant future unless sound measures are developed.','This article aims at examining how beliefs about music piracy, motives and practices as well as ethical orientations and attitudes relate to illegal downloading. More precisely, this research shows that:\n\n*Past behavior is likely to condition future behavior through a habituation effect.\n\n*Appealing to students using a guilt appeal is not likely to be effective.\n\n*There is a disconnection between a student’s ethical nature and their social and ethical beliefs about downloading.\n\n*Intentions to download are associated with beliefs that there is no social cost to downloading; there are social benefits to downloading; it is ethical to download; and there are legal consequences to downloading.\n\n*The fear of punishment (i.e. consequences of downloading) does have a negative impact on the intention to commit downloading.\n\n*Students are in the middle of the scale in expressing their likelihood of downloading such music and are more “considerate” to artists who have been less successful. Also, students believe that their peers are more likely than they to engage in unethical acts concerning stealing music in stores or on line.\n\n*Students’ ethics do have an impact on the propensity to engage in stealing music from a store or online, especially their ethical idealism.','- Despite the media attention given to the consequences of illegal downloading, students do not seem to be overly concerned.\n\n- Ethical orientation was not associated with past or future illegal downloading activity. However, if ethical idealism can be increased, there is likely to be heightened consciousness about downloading.\n\n- The efficacy of using a guilt appeal as considered by the RIAA is questionable given the findings.\n\n- People may not identify ethics as an issue when it comes to nonphysical/tangible goods like digital files, as research on copying software seems to suggest.\n\n- If people suspect that they would be caught and punished, then they are less likely to download illegally.

This is particularly true for movie studios where content can be stolen and released through illegitimate digital distribution channels before, or shortly after, the legitimate release date. In response to this potential threat, movie studios have spent millions of dollars attempting to protect their content from unauthorized release, to prosecute those who might distribute or consume pirated content, and to lobby governments to strengthen anti-piracy laws.\nHowever, surprisingly, there has been very little rigorous research to analyze whether,\nand how much, movie piracy cannibalizes legitimate sales. In this paper, we analyze\nthis question in the context of pre-release movie piracy. Using data collected from a\nunique Internet file-sharing site, we find that pre-release piracy significantly reduces a\nmovie’s market potential, although movies with pre-release piracy exhibit a slower sales\ndecline over time. We estimate that the net effect of pre-release piracy is approximately\na 15% reduction in box office sales.\nOur study contributes to the growing literature on piracy and digital media consumption in the Information Systems community by presenting evidence of the impact of Internet-based movie piracy, by taking a pre-release perspective to strengthen causal inference, and by differentiating the effect of pre-release movie piracy from the other types of piracy that the extant literature has previously considered.','This study finds that prerelease pirating reduces box office income by 15%, and higher quality audio and video in a pirated film have less of an impact on box office income than lower quality counterparts.  This behaviour may act as a substitute for moviegoing or, through word of mouth, may increase sales over time; there is a possibility for prerelease pirating to act as promotion; however, it has the potential to come at the cost of cannabilisation of box office sales if the quality of the movie is low and word-of-mouth is not strong.','This empirical information on the impact of prerelease pirating on box office sales impact can be used to justify policy and legal changes, for which creative industries previously had little evidence.','http://www.researchgate.net/publication/228280129_The_Effect_of_Pre-Release_Movie_Piracy_on_Box-Office_Revenue/links/000060a80cf270e24c893abd.pdf; http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1782924',NULL,0,0,0,'The data on 475 movies was culled from four sources: IMDB.com  (for tracking all releases from 2006-2009), BoxOfficeMojo.com, Yahoo movies (both for box office sales and other logistical film information, such as MPAA rating and critic ranking), and vcdquality.com (for monitoring when pirated films became available).

The Pew Internet & American Life Project’s \ninterest in studying artists and musicians grew out of our previous work studying internet users’ consumption of music and other creative content online. Through a series of reports on music downloading and file-sharing, we have observed and documented the changing behaviors and attitudes of an American public learning to negotiate the ever-changing copyright landscape of the digital world.\n\nHowever, over the course of observing the explosive growth and persistence of peer-to-\npeer networks, and following the entertainment industry’s ongoing efforts to police these activities and promote licensed digital music services, we found that there were few sources of quantitative research directed at understanding how these issues affect both musicians and the greater creative community. We found ourselves hard-pressed to answer some of the most basic questions about artists and the internet. For instance, how many artists have access to the internet? How many promote and sell their work online? How are they using the internet to develop their work, their connections to other artists, or their connections to audiences and the \nworld-at-large? How do they feel about controversies over copyright and fair use of creative material in the heyday of peer-to-peer systems like the original Napster and the current Kazaa and BitTorrent?  \n\nThe debate about copyright in the digital era has primarily centered on the recording \nindustry’s opposition to unauthorized file-sharing and downloading, a stance that has \nbeen both lauded and criticized by popular musicians. This clash over new technology \ngrows out of a long history of disputes between business and artists about the proper \nbalance between creators, the people who pay for and market creations, and consumers \nwho want access to large catalogs of digital music files and argue that there are many non-infringing uses of peer-to-peer. While music has been at the forefront of this discussion, the movie industry has also recently began suing individual downloaders. \n\nIn our surveys between 2000 and 2003, we found growing numbers of music downloaders who said they didn’t care about the copyright on the files they were acquiring. Technology firms accommodated this demand by creating and marketing an ever-widening array of devices to copy and store music files. Moreover, the growth of home broadband connections has made it progressively easier to share and download \nMP3 files. The recording industry’s response to this apparent apathy towards copyright and the ease of getting free files online was to file more than 7,000 lawsuits directed against alleged file-sharers since September 2003. After the first legal actions by the RIAA, the number of people who said in our surveys that they \ndownloaded music files dropped dramatically but has since rebounded to a degree.\n\nEconomic analysis of recorded music sales data and its relationship to music file-sharing activity is ongoing. At the same time, there is much to be learned from studying developments on the ground level. In the end, the future of any industry whose content can be digitized hinges on the creativity and innovation of artists.  \nBut there are strong concerns within the artistic community, and by prominent legal \nscholars, about the effectiveness of current copyright terms and their enforcement in the online world. Some argue that our understanding of copyright law has strayed far from its original purpose and that the internet calls for an inherently different interpretation of what constitutes copyright infringement and what qualifies as fair use of digitized works. Furthermore, many have raised concerns about the practical difficulties of the permissions process for creators and that too few new works are passing into the public domain. \n\nArtists are avid consumers as well as creators of online content. They often borrow from previous works and use that for inspiration for their own creativity. They represent the leading edge of media consumption online. Yet artists’ perspectives and first-hand experiences with the internet – both those of musicians and the larger creative community – have rarely been examined at the national level.\n\nThere are good reasons for this apparent gap in studying artists as consumers as well as producers. They are a notoriously difficult group to define with objective measures and are often prohibitively expensive to contact in large numbers. Musicians, in particular, are often required to travel extensively, which makes them difficult to reach with traditional telephone survey methods. \n\nThe Pew Internet & American Life Project has undertaken several research initiatives to begin to probe these issues of how musicians and artists use the internet and how they feel about the copyright issues that have emerged in the digital age. There were three core research instruments for this study. The findings from these three surveys, while covering similar themes, are discussed in separate sections of the report in order to emphasize the important methodological \ndifferences between the samples. Additionally, each sample serves a different purpose, so we anticipate that some readers will appreciate having the data presented discretely in the sections that follow. \n\nThe national sample of self-identified artists allowed us to ask questions of a broad, random, and representative sample of self-identified artists from around the country, to gather baseline data on internet use by a wide range of artists in the U.S. and probe their opinions on copyright issues online. However, reflecting both the well-known challenges of recruiting artists for research purposes and the conventional wisdom about the small number of career artists in the U.S., this sample was limited in its ability to include a large number of artists who rely almost exclus\nively on artistic work for their livelihood.  \n\nThe sample of online musicians, while not representative, allowed us to reach several \nthousand respondents, including a substantial portion of career musicians (those we \ndefine as “Success Stories” and “Starving Musicians” in the report) who have a \nconsiderable stake in discussing both the positive and negative effects of free \ndownloading online. The musician survey, because it was administered online, also gave us a chance to ask a more thorough list of questions about the internet that was uniquely catered to musical performers and songwriters.  \n\nFinally, the random and nationally representative sample of American adults provided a glimpse of how the views and experiences of average consumers compare to those of the creative public.','Main results of the study: \n\n*32 million Americans consider themselves artists and about 10 million of them get some kind of compensation for their creations and performances.  \n\n*More than three-quarters of all artists, 77%, and 83% of Paid Artists use the internet, compared to 63% of the entire population. Many site specific gains in their careers from their use of the internet.  \n\n*52% of all online artists and 59% of Paid Online Artists say they get ideas and inspiration for their work from searching online.  \n\n*30% of all online artists and 45% of Paid Online Artists say the internet is important in helping them create and/or distribute their art.  \n\n*23% of all online artists and 41% of Paid Online Artists say the internet has helped them in their creative pursuits and careers. \n\n*4% of all online artists and 8% of Paid Online Artists say the internet has made it much harder for their work to get noticed. \n\n*3% of all online artists and 6% of Paid Online Artists say the internet has had a major deleterious effect on their ability to protect their creative works.\n\n*Two-thirds of the musicians in the online survey say the internet is “very important” in helping them create and distribute their music. \n\n*90% of musicians use the internet to get ideas and inspiration.\n\n*87% of musicians use it to promote, advertise and post their music online. \n\n*83% of musicians offer free samples online and notable numbers report benefits from that such as higher CD sales, larger concert attendance, and more radio play.\n\n*77% have their own Web site.\n\n*69% sell their music somewhere online.\n\n*66% use the internet to collaborate with others. Many independent musicians, in particular, see the internet as an alternative way to bypass traditional distribution outlets.   \n\n*Artists say the current copyright laws do a good job of protecting the rights of creators and most have no qualms about the length of copyright protection that the law currently allows. \n\n*64% of all artists and 67% of Paid Artists think that the copyright owner should have complete control over the use of that work.  \n\n*Half of all artists say that copyright regulations generally benefit purveyors of art work more than the original creators. Musicians echo those views. \n\n*Just 28% of artists consider file-sharing to be a major threat and 30% of Paid Artists say this. Among the musicians in our online survey, two-thirds say file-sharing poses a minor threat or no threat at all.  \n\n*19% of Digitized Artists say unauthorized copies of their works have been posted online.  \n\n*52% of all artists and 55% of Paid Artists believe it should be illegal for internet users to share unauthorized copies of music and movies over file-sharing networks, compared to 37% of all artists and 35% of Paid Artists who say it should be legal. \n\n*Artists are evenly divided in their assessment about whether file-sharing programs are a net good or a net bad for their colleagues, while the musicians we surveyed are more likely to see the positive aspects of file-sharing. \n\n*47% of all artists agree with the statement that “file-sharing services are bad for artists because they allow people to copy or use an artist’s work without getting permission or compensating the artist.”\n\n*43% agree that, “file-sharing services aren’t really bad for artists, since they help to promote and distribute an artist’s work to a broad audience.”  \n\n*When asked about burning a copy of a music or movie CD for a friend, artists’ views become sharply divided; 46% think it should be legal, and 48% say it should be illegal. Paid Artists are marginally more likely to consider CD burning to be an infringing behavior. \n\n*46% of artists believe that it should be legal to send a digital copy of music over the internet to someone they know, but 49% say it should be illegal. \n\n*The musicians we surveyed were similarly divided over burning a CD for a friend; 47% think this should be legal while 41% think it should be illegal. However, most say that sending a digital copy of music over the internet to someone they know should be permitted. \n\n*Of those artists who download music files (n=118), most think that downloading has not really changed the total amount they spend on music purchases like CDs, concerts, or other music products (58% say this). \n\n*29% of artists say they think downloading has actually increased what they spend on music purchases overall, and 13% say it has decreased their purchases. \n\n*Among artists who either download music or video files (n=139), 86% say that when they download files for free, they usually end up supporting the artist or author in other ways, such as buying a CD or book or going to a performance. \n\n*Just over half of all artists who download music or video files say they can’t always tell if it’s legal or illegal to download media files from the internet. \n\n*More than two-thirds of the sample said they don’t currently pay to download any type of media files, but they would if the price, quality and choice they want become available.','None.','http://www.pewinternet.org/files/old-media/Files/Reports/2004/PIP_Artists.Musicians_Report.pdf.pdf','http://www.pewinternet.org/files/old-media/Files/Reports/2004/PIP_Artists.Musicians_Report.pdf.pdf',0,0,0,'There are three sets of data: \n\n*A random and nationally representative telephone survey in December 2003 of 809 American adults who said they are artists. \n\n*A non-random online survey of 2,793 musicians, songwriters and music publishers distributed through musician membership organizations was conducted on the Web from March 15-April 15, 2004.

This article reports a series of experiments revealing that these debates are actually orthogonal to how most users and many creators understand intellectual property law. The most common perception of intellectual property among the American public is that intellectual property law is designed to prevent plagiarism.\n\nThe plagiarism fallacy in intellectual property law is not an innocuous misperception. This fallacy likely helps explain pervasive illegal infringing activity on the Internet, common dismissal of copyright warnings, and other previously puzzling behavior. The received wisdom has been that the public is ethically dismissive or indifferent towards intellectual property rights. This research reveals instead that experts have failed to comprehend what the public’s conception of intellectual property law actually is.\n\nThe studies reported here uncover several additional intellectual property law findings, including that: (1) the majority of the American public views intellectual property rights as too broad and too strong, (2) knowledge of intellectual property law does not affect opinions about what the law should be, and (3) there are significant demographic and cultural divides concerning intellectual property rights. The findings as a whole raise central questions concerning the public legitimacy of intellectual property law, and consequently its ability to function as intended.','This survey presents an original series of experiments that reveal preventing plagiarism to be the leading perceived basis for intellectual property protection in the United States. It formulates a plagiarism fallacy theory through a series of three experiments concerning popular understandings and preferences for intellectual property rights. More specifically, it shows that: \n\n* There is a dominant focus on moral and ethical concerns with copying, but not legal concerns.\n\n* Preventing plagiarism is the most commonly selected objective, surpassing all traditionally identified objectives, including incentive, natural rights, and expressive alternatives.\n\n* Across a wide variety of subject matters and contexts, people tend to believe that simply providing proper attribution to the originator of a creative work or invention should enable the free copying of their work by others.\n\n* Americans have an extremely low level of knowledge about intellectual property law\n\n* Knowledge of intellectual property law does not affect individual opinions about what the law should be. \n\n* There are demographic and cultural divides concerning intellectual property law based upon peoples’ gender, age, income, and political identity.','The study recommends research and measures aimed at aligning the public psychology of intellectual property with the reality of intellectual property law - if the widespread disconnect between these two elements continues, the intellectual property system will remain hard<pressed to achieve its objectives.','http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2588658','http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2588658',0,0,0,'This survey uses three different datasets of individuals living in USA.

Seventy percent of respondents in the patent condition answered that the computer program developer should be entitled to monetary damages, a response consistent with intellectual property law, versus 19% who believed that the creator should not be so entitled. Fifty-nine percent of respondents in the copyright condition concluded that the songwriter was entitled to monetary damages, while 31% believed that the creator was not. Though this provides a majority response consistent with copyright law, it is a relatively weak majority, and a far smaller differential (28%) than the patent scenario (51%). Results are displayed in Figure 1.93 Two-tailed binomial tests reveal that participants were significantly more likely to conclude that the creator was entitled to damages than to conclude that the creator was not entitled to damages in both the patent (p < .001) and copyright (p < .001) scenarios\n\n* Scenario 2: Creativity Threshold. rsuant to patent law’s requirement that the invention be nonobvious.

Two-tailed binomial tests demonstrate that participants were significantly more likely to grant intellectual property protection to a novel, obvious creation than to deny protection in both the patent (p < .001) and copyright (p < .001) scenarios.\n\n*  Scenario 3: Independent Creators. Consistent with copyright law, 60% of participants in the copyright condition concluded that the later, independent sculptor should be entitled to separate intellectual property rights in the second sculpture. Contrary to patent law, 55% of participants in the patent condition concluded that the later, independent inventor should be entitled to separate intellectual property rights in the second medical device.

The case of software piracy','Using data on software piracy, we examine how protection of intellectual property varies across countries. Consistent with other studies, we find that intellectual property receives greater protection in developed economies; high-income countries have lower piracy rates. We also find that protection depends on cultural factors. Countries with an individualist culture have lower piracy rates than do countries with a collectivist culture. Piracy rates are also lower in countries that have strong institutions that enforce contracts and protect property from expropriation. These results suggest that national policies towards intellectual property reflect not only economic concerns but also national culture and institutions.','Software piracy rates can be explained by a few economic, institutional, cultural variables. Countries with high per-capita income, a tradition of individualism, and/or strong institutions protecting contracts and property tend to have low piracy rates. Countries with high levels of education and high R&D intensity also have low piracy rates; however, these relationships are weak, at best, in regressions that account for economic development, culture , and institutional strength.','These findings have several implications. First, they support the argument that intellectual property is a cultural phenomenon as well as an economic one. Countries with a collective culture- one that emphasizes sharing over individual ownership rights - have significantly higher piracy rates that do countries with an individualistic culture. Second, the results indicate the important link between economic institutions and intellectual property. Countries that protect contracts and traditional property also tend to be ones that protect intellectual property to software. Third, they indicate that the positive correlation between economic development and protection of intellectual property (i.e. low piracy rates) need not be casual. Although the exact relationship between economic development and intellectual property protection is unclear, it appears that much of the positive correlation can be explained by cultural and institutional factors that are correlated with economic development. \nTaken together these results suggest that efforts to reform intellectual property rights around the world must be sensitive to differences in cultural traditions and economic institutions, as well as differences in economic development.','http://econpapers.repec.org/article/oupecinqu/v_3a38_3ay_3a2000_3ai_3a2_3ap_3a159-74.htm','http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1465-7295.2000.tb00011.x/abstract',0,0,0,''),('Marshall_(2004)','Marshall (2004)','http://www.copyrightevidence.org/evidence-wiki/index.php/Marshall_(2004)',2004,'The effects of piracy upon the music industry: a case study of bootlegging','\"I don’t think the record company loses one cent on a bootleg. If they go after bootleggers, they’re wasting their money.\" (Max, a bootlegger, in Vettel, 1986)\n\nEach year, the International Federation of the Phonographic Industry (IFPI) releases a figure indicating the global value of pirated music. In 2000, this figure was $4.2 billion (IFPI, 2001). The IFPI argues that the actual losses suffered by the industry are not fully represented by this figure: ‘The value of the pirate market does not indicate losses in revenue to the legitimate recording industry, which are likely to be far greater’ (2001). These figures are then used in a strenuous lobbying campaign for the creation and enforcement of tougher copyright laws demanding, for example, restrictions on private copying exemptions, deterrent penalties and the dismantling of compulsory licensing provisions. This lobbying campaign is only likely to intensify in the future in response to online copying and the proliferation of CD burners. The IFPI, and its American equivalent, the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) are skilful and powerful lobbyists, and past evidence suggests that policy-makers will continue to be influenced by their arguments.\n\nThe effects of piracy are, however, more difficult to ascertain. This is for three reasons. First, the word ‘piracy’ is a blanket term covering a wide variety of activities, including counterfeiting, pirating, bootlegging, home taping, tape trading and online file sharing. All of these areas of piracy have individual characteristics that make any attempt at synthesis a hazardous and, some might say, misleading venture. Second, the world of illegal recordings is not the easiest from which to gather data. As Jeremy Phillips writes: \"Unfortunately, counterfeiters do not yet have to file annual returns to the Commission on the scale of their illegal activity, which means that the figures put forward for losses caused by counterfeiting are in danger of being subjective, hypothetical and methodologically flawed. (1999: 275)\"\n\nPiracy figures are often used for their rhetorical impact rather than as a reflection of reality. Thirdly, and perhaps most importantly, recording industry statistics do not take into account the variety of different meanings and uses that pirated music takes in the day-to-day lives of many people. Music plays an important role in the creation of meaning in many people’s lives, and the industry’s concern with questions of supply (who owns these recordings?) has neglected important questions of demand (why do people want them?) (Frith, 2002). This results in a distorted impression of the effects of piracy. For example, music industry representatives lobbying for a levy on blank audio tape in the early 1980s (and again for blank digital audio tape later in the decade) argued that every blank tape sold resulted in one less official sale (Frith, 1987: 59). The small amount of non-industry sponsored research conducted into the area, however, indicates that people often use blank tapes in non-displacing activities (for example, Brown et al., 2001; Cohen, 1990).\n\nThis article looks at one area of piracy – bootlegging – and discusses its possible effects upon the official industry. It begins by briefly differentiating bootlegging from other forms of piracy, and then provides an overview of the scale of bootlegging and the type of music fans who buy bootlegs. Following this, it discusses the possible effects of bootlegging upon the official industry. Bootlegging is a highly idiosyncratic area of piracy and the discussions here cannot necessarily be extrapolated to other spheres. However, the overall purpose of this article is to highlight the need for further research into the meanings of music piracy across a wide variety of settings in order to obtain a more realistic impression of the scale and effects of piracy in the music industry.','Main propositions and arguments of the study: \n\n*Bootlegging has always been a small-scale activity: following the closure of legal loopholes, a regular pressing of a bootleg title is about 500 copies worldwide. A very successful bootleg would then go to a second pressing of another 500 copies, but this is rare. Anything in the region of 3,000 sales would be considered enormous in bootlegging circles.\n\n*Given that a release by a major label has to sell around 300,000 copies just to break even, the greatest successes of the bootleggers would still rank among the most dismal of failures for the mainstream industry.\n\n*The people who buy bootlegs are extremely committed fans who use bootlegs as a way of maintaining an ongoing, meaningful relationship with their favoured artists or bands. \n\n*The recording industry argues that bootlegs detract from officially released record sales: but the collector’s interest in the unofficial recordings of an artist generally stems from an extensive knowledge of their official canon, and thus the majority of bootleg buyers will own all the official releases of their artist(s) before even beginning to buy bootlegs. \n\n*This loyalty has often been exploited by the record labels: through box sets, unreleased recordings, multiple great hits and singles collections etc. \n\n*The recording industry argues that recording artists and songwriters do not obtain any royalty payments from the sale of a bootleg: the majority of bootlegs are of live performances and these tend to involve someone smuggling a recording device into the venue and recording the show. If this is so, then the artist (and his record label) has received payment for that performance in the shape of ticket sales (not including the revenue generated from sales of concert souvenirs such as T-shirts). The artist (and her record label) have in fact received significant income from the performance that features on a bootleg.','Policy Implications:\n\n*Bootlegging could have some positive economic effects upon the official recording industry which balance out any perceived disadvantages to the industry. \n\n*The effects of piracy are complex and multifaceted, and the statistics released by the official industry do not reflect their complexity. \n\n*Research into piracy in the music industry must reflect the various forms of musical and legal meanings that individuals attach to music, and their consumption of it. Music is a commodity that requires legal protection, but the meanings given to that commodity are not merely the ones set out by those who produce it.','http://www.academia.edu/1935331/The_effects_of_piracy_upon_the_music_industry_A_case_study_of_bootlegging','http://mcs.sagepub.com.ezproxy.lib.gla.ac.uk/',0,0,0,'The author refers to interviews and email correspondence with bootleggers, but does not disclose any details of how many interview/correspondence subjects took part, whether the interviews were face to face or over the phone, or how long they lasted.

After controlling for an autoregressive component and a declining time trend in sales, the file-sharing elasticity of sales is not statistically different from zero in the difference GMM estimations. The results hold when external instruments are used. Moreover, the results suggest an upper bound of −0.21 of elasticity, indicating that the short-term sales displacement effect is moderate at worst.','*There are some differences between the popularity of movies on sales charts and on BitTorrent. On average, blockbusters which are successful at the box office sell more in DVDs and are heavily downloaded on BitTorrent.\n\n*Compared to top selling movies the genres of sci-fi, action and drama/thriller were overrepresented on BitTorrent\'s most popular titles\n\n*People buying DVDs and people downloading are two distinct groups with different tastes and characteristics\n\n*Supply side issues,which are not necessarily related to the overall popularity of a specific movie,play a crucial role in determining the success of a movie amongst the file-sharers\n\n*The focus of the study is short term and the results indicate that the immediate sales replacement effect of file-sharing is surprisingly moderate.','File-sharing is related to the well-studied problem of optimal degree of intellectual property protection. At the heart of the problem is the trade-off between social welfare and incentives to create. Creating is costly, while the marginal cost of producing a digital copy from the original is zero. Without considering the incentives of creators and with zero marginal cost, social welfare would be maximized by allowing the product to be copied freely. However, if incentives to create are hampered due to piracy, there are no creative products to consume. In a dynamic setting, when incentives are considered, piracy can thus result in a welfare loss. However, piracy affects incentives to create through reduced revenue only if consumers who would have otherwise\nbought a legal product acquire an illegal copy, that is, if piracy substitutes sales. \n\nFrom the creator’s perspective the consequences of copying and thus incentives to create depend on the “market harm” of copying: the way in which the availability of unauthorized copies substitutes sales and decreases revenue. The concept of market harm is crucial from legal perspective as well.It is exactly the estimation of the “harmfulness of use” which is the main focus of this paper.','http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1742443 ; http://www.researchgate.net/publication/228294444_Does_file-sharing_reduce_DVD_sales','http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs11066-014-9085-0',0,0,0,'To study the short-term effect of movie downloads on DVD sales, data on weekly DVD sales and movie torrent downloads in the USA during a 13-week period from March 2 to May 31, 2009 is used.'),('Marvasti_(2000)','Marvasti (2000)','http://www.copyrightevidence.org/evidence-wiki/index.php/Marvasti_(2000)',2000,'Motion Pictures Industry:Economies of Scale and Trade','Recent economic theories find industrial structure to be an important determinant of the pattern of trade.

Through passive monitoring and deep packet inspection (DPI), we assess the extent to which P2P is used to transfer copyrighted material. We also characterize the demographics of P2P users, the relative popularity of the material, and how the burden on the campus network varies over time. We found that at least 51% of students living on campus engaged in P2P, at least 42% attempted to transfer copyrighted material, and the mean number of copyrighted media titles whose transfer is attempted per week was at least 6 per monitored student. Some students use P2P legally, e.g. to transfer Linux software or non-copyrighted adult material, but we found no evidence that large numbers of students use P2P for these legal purposes and not to transfer copyrighted material. Students of all genders, ages, classes and majors engaged in file sharing, to the extent that demographics were not helpful in identifying likely file-sharers so as to target interventions. This study also provides lessons for those who would use DPI technology to reduce illegal use of P2P. If given enough weeks to observe, current technology is effective at identifying users who attempt to transfer copyrighted material, provided that their traffic is identifiable as P2P. Thus, DPI can be used to estimate the extent of piracy, and to notify individuals who may be violating copyright law. However, encryption is available and can be easily activated in most P2P clients. Once turned on, encryption prevents DPI from detecting whether transferred material is copyrighted, rendering it ineffective. If DPI is used for copyright enforcement that includes imposition of penalties, then P2P users or P2P developers may have the incentive to use encryption as a way of evading detection.','* The study detected P2P activity by about half of the students living on campus (51%) and the great majority of those (42%) were also detected transferring or attempting to transfer copyrighted material. \n* During the monitored period, the average number of copyrighted media titles detected being transferred per student was 18. Out of the students found transferring or attempting to transfer copyrighted material, 70% were detected attempting more than one copyrighted title per day.\n* Demographics were poor predictors of whether or how much students engage in P2P or in transfers of copyrighted material.

Even so, the average number of titles per week decreases for older students or student s closer to graduation. \n* File sharing occurred at all times of the day and night, peaking on weeknights when people are typically not using their computers. \n* The study provides useful lessons on use of DPI technology to reduce illegal activities, as results indicate today’s technology is effective in detecting users that transfer copyrighted material using unencrypted P2P.','* DPI can be a useful diagnostic tool for universities or ISPs that wish to warn their students or customers about possible risk of lawsuits from the copyright industry or target education to users that are detected in copyright infringement. \n* Lawmakers could decide to require that operators use DPI to monitor their networks and enforce anti-piracy policies by assigning penalties. \n* Some policy makers may consider prohibiting use of encryption with P2P.

For example, we estimate that 10.7 songs were transferred using BitTorrent for every song sold, 3.6 movies were transferred using BitTorrent for every legal sale or rental of a DVD or Blu-ray, and 227 movies were transferred using BitTorrent for every paid download. We also find that the vast majority of music and video content transferred using BitTorrent is copyrighted, as demonstrated both by the swarm metadata we observed, and the fact that only 0.55% of the transfers were of files indexed by websites that specialize in content that can be transferred legally.\nThis article assesses what and how much content is transferred using BitTorrent, currently the most popular file sharing P2P protocol in use, with the purpose of fulfilling three objectives. The first objective is to provide a reasonable empirically derived lower bound for the number of copies of copyrighted titles transferred using BitTorrent.  The second objective is to break that lower bound down into categories depending on characteristics of\ncontent transferred.  The third objective is to understand which content formats and technical characteristics of content (different methods of video digitalization, video resolutions and audio bit rates) users prefer.','* BitTorrent transfers result in hundreds of millions of copyright violations worldwide per day, and that copyright holders fail to realize significant revenues as a result. \n* Movies are the type of content most supplied and most transferred in BitTorrent (shared in 38.7% of swarms and accounting for 26.1% of transfers). Songs and software, despite being shared in small percentages of swarms (4.5% and 7.2% of swarms respectively), rank 2nd and 3rd in terms of transfers (with 20.4% and 16.8% of transfers respectively).\n* This demonstrates limitations of past studies that estimated the economic impact of P2P by looking at which content is available rather than trying to measure the number of actual transfers. Surprisingly, most of the copies transferred using BitTorrent come from a small number of extremely popular titles; 37 song titles account for half of all songs transferred, and 117 movies account half of all movie transfers. Thus, for a global marketplace, the importance of the “long tail” of less popular content is smaller than we and others have observed in more localized studies. In general, the content that is popular in legal channels is also popular with BitTorrent, but we observe some important differences. For example, we find that content that is popular among teenagers is more likely to be disproportionally represented in BitTorrent transfers as compared to content that appeals to an older audience.','From a legal perspective, the findings show that copyright law is infringed hundreds of millions of times per day around the world. From the perspective of the revenue of copyright holders, it indicates that there is likely significant revenue that is not realized due to the impact of such illegal transfers.','http://users.ece.cmu.edu/~peha/quantifying_global_P2P.pdf','http://users.ece.cmu.edu/~peha/quantifying_global_P2P.pdf',0,0,0,'Using data collected over 106 days between August 2010 and February 2011 from the most popular\npublic BitTorrent tracker, we find an average of 2.6 million BitTorrent swarms offering content at any moment, from which we estimate that a lower bound of 380 million copies of content with more than 1024 bytes are transferred on average per day.'),('Mattioli_(2014)','Mattioli (2014)','http://www.copyrightevidence.org/evidence-wiki/index.php/Mattioli_(2014)',2014,'Disclosing Big Data','This Article reveals that the law is failing to adequately encourage producers of “big data” to disclose their most innovative work to the public. “Big data” refers to a new industrial and scientific phenomenon that holds the potential to transform diverse industries — from medicine, to energy, to online services. At the heart of this phenomenon are innovative and complex practices by which experts shape featureless digital records into valuable information products. The fact that these big data practices are unlikely to be disclosed to the public is worrisome for familiar reasons: the law generally prefers to induce technological disclosure in order to serve the goal of promoting progress. Beyond this general concern, the nondisclosure of big data practices threatens innovation in unique ways that are particularly insidious. The cause of this problem, and possibly its resolution, lies in the interplay between big data and intellectual property law — a nexus that scholars have not explored until now.','Main results of the study:\n\n*Big data practices do not fit neatly into the traditional intellectual property paradigms of patent or copyright. \n\n*Existing intellectual property policy does little to meaningfully encourage the disclosure of big data practices. \n\n*A variety of forces, both legal and economic, are powerfully pushing data producers toward nondisclosure.\n\n*Big data practices are highly subjective, and difficult to uncover through reverse engineering. As a result, big data practices lend themselves toward secrecy. \n\n*Findings varied across different types of big data practices: filtering non-relevant data (i.e., \"noise\") from large datasets; identifying and correcting errors based on estimates or guesses; \"masking\" data in order to preserve the anonymity of individuals; and classifying data.','Policy implications: \n\n*There is a need to encourage greater disclosure of big data practices. There may be many ways to further this goal, such as new rulemaking within federal agencies, or perhaps a legislative change to intellectual property law. \n\n*This article explores the latter possibility by presenting a dataright as an exploratory device. By offering big data producers something new and valuable-an exclusive right to limit downstream use of their data-this new intellectual property right could encourage valuable technological disclosures that would otherwise remain shrouded in secrecy. \n\n*This solution would carry substantial drawbacks however: it would encourage disclosure only in settings where data producers value data exclusivity more than they value secrecy in their methods. Moreover, this solution would entail significant new costs. Whether these costs would be outweighed by the plan\'s benefits would be a productive starting point for future discussion.\n\n*In light of big data\'s growing economic and social importance, policymakers and the public should be concerned with how the legal system will influence the production and use of this valuable new resource. Currently, the intellectual property system is not well configured to meet its goal of encouraging technological disclosures in this new frontier.','http://dx.doi.org/10.2139/ssrn.2358985','http://www.minnesotalawreview.org/',0,0,0,'This study draws on a set of interviews and surveys that the author conducted with informaticists, data scientists, lawyers, and business professionals working in big data across different industries. \nThe author assembled a listing of all big data companies, initiatives, and projects described in national newspapers, books, journals, and online press published since 2009.

This can be achieved by explaining the nuances relating to each licence in clear and simple language, rather than simply ‘encouraging’ the user to adopt a particular type of licence.

Learning lessons from the past','Additive Layer Manufacturing or 3D printing as it is more commonly known is increasingly being embraced by the manufacturing sectors. The technology, although, in its early stages has already raised questions pertaining to intellectual property (IP) implications. This paper considers the IP implications of 3D printing. In particular the paper considers the challenges to patent law, trademark law, copyright law and design law as a result of this emerging technology. The paper also questions whether lessons can be learned from the entertainment industry and the manner in which this industry has attempted to deal with online piracy. The paper suggests that rather than focusing on stringent IP laws, the future in dealing with emerging technologies which challenges IP laws lie in adopting new business models in adapting to technologies such as 3D printing.','*  It is important to \"adapt\" to 3D printing and \"adopt\" new business models rather than focus merely on the law\n\n* IP implications of 3D printing are far from clear. While 3D printing a product may not infringe one element of IP law, it is quite possible that it will breach another type of IP. To complicate matters, the above assessment also revealed that the same branch of IP can lead to both infringement and non-infringement of protected products which are 3D printed. For example, while under s.10 of TMA 1994, it will be an infringement to print a product protected by a trade mark, s.11(2) states that if labelled correctly, infringement can be avoided\n\n* Similar to online platforms such as Napster, Grokster, Pirate Bay and Megaupload which facilitated and induced online infringement of copyright, it is quite possible that new online platforms such as Thingiverse, Shapeways, Cubify and Quirky will facilitate 3D printing of products—which are protected by IP laws—in time to come. However, unlike MP3 files and video copying which produced perfect copies, the same will not be true for 3D printing. \n\n* The material that will be needed to carry out 3D printing, could prove to be a challenge, but this could be an opportunity for the start-up of new businesses and business ventures specialising in raw materials which will be needed for 3D printing. At present prices vary from €30 to €218 depending on the amount of raw material needed\n\n* It is difficult to compete with free —i.e. pirated and counterfeit content which is available online for free','* The most obvious, yet most important recommendation in adapting to 3D printing is to adopt a new business model.\n\n* One suggestion for manufacturers is to join together to create a parts store, similar to the iTunes model.150 The objective would be to provide for a convenient one-stop-shop for buying (spare) parts, for 3D printing, for a small fee. The drawback of this model is the risk of creating a monopoly. The entertainment industry welcomed Apple’s iTunes business model when it was launched and was in fact reluctant to license to anyone else. Now, with Apple having the upper hand or the monopoly, the entertainment industry is in constant negotiation with Apple regarding their pricing strategy. The stakeholder most likely to lose out from such negotiations is the artist. In the present context, it could be the manufacturer who could be losing out. Bearing in mind the above drawback, maybe a better option would be to license 3D files more widely\n\n* On a more practical level, stores should consider having a physical presence and an online presence with a 3D arm attached to the online store as well—where 3D designs can be sold for a competitive price. \n\n* It is hoped that the law will not stifle 3D printing\n\n* The time will come when significant decisions will need to be made. At that time, one option will be to follow in the footsteps of the entertainment industry and shy away from the technology, thereby enforcing stricter intellectual property laws; or be more creative by adapting to the emerging 3D technology by adopting new business models. In learning valuable lessons from the entertainment industry’s experience, the hope is that the latter option will be chosen.',NULL,'http://staffprofiles.bournemouth.ac.uk/display/journal-article/150294',0,0,0,'The author reviews the IP regimes and their application to 3D printing'),('Merz_(2005)','Merz (2005)','http://www.copyrightevidence.org/evidence-wiki/index.php/Merz_(2005)',2005,'Intellectual Property and Product Development Public/Private Partnerships','This is the final report of an interview study of US-based product development public/private partnerships (PDPPPs) focused on the development of new drugs, vaccines, and other products for diseases that disproportionately affect developing countries.

A different Respondent associated with the same organization reported a case, perhaps one of those discussed above, of an affiliated academic scientist who avoided use of a patented antigen, choosing instead a less scientifically preferred alternative.

Few Respondents reported cases in which they were unable to secure licenses.  Two Respondents reported that their organizations had approached firms that held exclusive NIH licenses on, in one case, a potentially blocking patent, and in another, a desirable technology, and in each case licenses were outright refused.  In the latter case, the PDPPP was able to invent around the technology.  A third Respondent reported that a company had refused to grant a license for an “enabling technology” even though it was for a different field of use, and the PDPPP was able to use other technologies to fill the gap.  A fourth Respondent related a case in which a vaccine was exclusively licensed by the NIH with worldwide rights to a large pharmaceutical firm, which had no intention to market in the developing world; the NIH was heavily – and successfully -- lobbied to get them to alter their licensing strategy in subsequent technology transfer agreements.\n\n*Overall, most Respondents did not perceive IP issues to be insurmountable, but they clearly are requiring substantial efforts in time and money to manage.  As one Respondent put it, his “day job is to work around tough IP issues.”  Several Respondents mentioned the high costs of patents, maintenance fees, freedom to operate studies, and legal services related to contract negotiations, the costs of which they would prefer to spend on their science.','The PDPPPs studied here can be characterized as a fledgling “industry”; just over half of the organizations are less than 5 years old, and only 2 predate 1990.

These two constructs, in turn, will impact on one’s attitude towards software piracy, and hence, on the level of one’s pirating behavior. We test the model using a sample of U.S. business students and find strong support for the model, with an understanding of the number of jobs lost due to software piracy being the dominant factor. This suggests that decision makers in the software industry need to refocus educational outreach programs from stressing the illegality of copyright infringement to emphasizing the social consequences of such behavior.','This article aims at empirically examining the question of whether people stop engaging in software piracy when they understand that software piracy is a crime and has harmful social and economic consequences.

Second, most studies have used the dataset from the pre-2003 methodology which only accounted for business software and did not take into account local market conditions.

These demographics are key properties of the cognitive-developmental, gender socialization, and occupational socialization theories. We find the overall level of reported buying is low, while the level of sharing and use is high. From the perspective of socialization, we find differences in levels of buying based on gender, differences in levels of sharing based on age and gender, and differences in levels of use based on years of work experience. This suggests the source of pirated software has shifted from buying to a diffusion network that involves sharing within certain social groups. The higher rate of use for those with more years of work experience reinforces a continual problem for software vendors: The inability of customers to pay for software that is deemed necessary to conduct business.','Usage levels of pirated software remain high. There has been a shift in acquisition behaviour with users predominantly downloading and sharing pirated software rather than buying pirate discs in-store.  Pirated software is shared through a diffusion network of family, friends, and colleagues that requires fewer purchases of pirate discs and is maintained principally by female members. The study provides a better sociological understanding of piracy behaviour and a person\'s propensity to engage in software piracy as follows:\n\n*  Sharing pirated software has twice the impact of buying, in that the diffusion of pirated software amongst a social group is less dependant on the purchase of a pirate disc and more upon the acquisition of a copy through friends, colleagues or peer to peer networks;\n\n* No form of socialisation (age, gender or work experience) can account for a propensity to engage in buying, sharing and using pirated software. Significant correlations are found relative to each single category however;\n\n* Younger people are more likely to share pirated software than older people; \n\n* Males tend to be the initiators (buyers) and females are the facilitators (sharers) of the software piracy diffusion network;\n\n* Number of years of work experience is the only socialisation variable to detect a difference in using pirate software. People with more work experience are more likely to use pirate software.','Software vendors need to make strategic decisions to deal with software piracy. It is sensible to continue the policy of raids on companies thought to be using pirated software as well as policing shops and online stores. Controlling software piracy will be most effective by conducting a campaign that raises the awareness of the illegality of software piracy and persuades individuals that software piracy is wrong. Anti piracy campaigners need to adapt to the new market model presented by this study and take account of underlying socio-cultural forces if levels of piracy are to be reduced.

Also explored was the extent to which the social learning process mediated the impact of several noteworthy correlates of digital piracy among college students attending different universities (n=585), relying on a structural equation modeling (SEM) framework.

That is, individuals are likely to follow the social learning process that will lead them to digital piracy. The results also indicate that consistent correlates of digital piracy (e.g., gender and age) are mediated by social learning theory. By exploring crimes similar to digital piracy, scholars can shed light on existing theories, such as, but not limited to social learning theory.\n\n- Scholars, and the society that they serve, have much to gain by giving attention to digital crimes. Through studying digital piracy, one can gain a better understanding of crime that takes place from behind a computer terminal. This allows for theories to be critiqued, reevaluated and modified.\n\n- Studying digital piracy is unique by the fact that it can be used as a strategic site for unveiling criminological concepts like social learning theory as they may apply to digital crimes. Accounting for differences in how a particular theory can explain terrestrial crimes versus digital crimes may have major implications for future theory and policy development.','From a policy implications standpoint, these results lead us to suggest that education is necessary in all regions about digital piracy.

We examine the impact of file-sharing on sales of recorded music and on the demand for live concert performances. We provide evidence suggesting that while file-sharing reduced album sales, it simultaneously increased demand for concerts.

While file-sharing may have substantially displaced album sales, it also facilitated a broader distribution of music, which appears to have expanded awareness of smaller artists and increased demand for their live concert performances. \n\n* Concert revenues for large artists, however, appear to have been largely unaffected by file-sharing. Music for large artists was likely widely available prior to file-sharing, and as a result it is not surprising that demand for those artists’ concerts would have been largely unaffected by file-sharing. \n\n* The decline in album sales is much more pronounced for large artists than for small artists. Large artists’ music may have been more readily available on file-sharing sites, in which case file-sharing would naturally have a bigger impact on large artists.

A survey questionnaire of 216 respondents was used to test the model. Consistent with the theory of planned behavior, the results showed that attitude toward online music piracy, subjective norms, and perceived behavioral control are significant antecedent factors of intention to commit online music piracy.

We use a probit model and primary data from a survey that collects information about P2P sharing behaviour of more than 2000 individuals. Our econometric results suggest that the motivations for contributing are poorly determined by rational self-interested behaviour.

However, the marginal effect is negative and very low.\n \n* The quest for cultural diversity makes individuals more likely to be a contributor than a free-rider in P2P networks. \n\n* The perception of legal and technical risks associated with sharing behaviour has no significant effect on contribution. \n\n* A moderate level of education is associated with a lower likelihood of being a contributor in P2P. \n\n* Age, income and occupation do not have a significant impact on behaviour in P2P networks. \n\n* Higher internet experience has significant positive impact on contribution behaviour. \n\n* Findings suggest that contribution behaviour is not well explained by an utilitarian approach. \n\n* Contribution behaviour can be motivated by social influence, and these practices are embedded in a social context. \n\n* Further research can explore the mechanisms by which this social influence explains the behaviour of contributors over P2P networks.','Policy implications reported in the study: \n\n* A major way to fight against P2P networks is to reduce their absolute utility by increasing the costs associated with contribution in order to dry up the supply of contents on P2P networks. However, the findings suggest copyright enforcement (in particular, increased sanctions, legal suits against individual copiers) has no impact on contribution behaviour. This might explain the failure of current enforcement strategies.\n\n* The findings cast some doubts on the efficiency of ‘réponse graduée,’ or the use of warnings and cease and desist letters: at best, this new form of copyright enforcement could eliminate the current P2P technology used to share contents. Any new sharing technology that would replace current P2P technology might be fuelled by the ‘supply’ of content contributors.\n\n* Another strategy is to decrease the relative utility of P2P networks by increasing the quality of services and diversity of contents available in the legal markets. Content industries should try to build innovative business models to compete efficiently with P2P content-sharing or even to extract the value from these sharing communities. \n\n* Copyright law could stimulate innovation by implementing compulsory licences in order to facilitate the acquisition of copyrights and increase the size of catalogue supplied to consumers in legal markets.','http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1336806','http://www.serci.org/rerci.html',0,0,0,'Online and pen/paper survey data gathered from 2533 individuals; sample reduced to 2068 after missing values were removed.

Yet in several recent empirical studies, leading scholars have found some order in fair use case law where others have seen only chaos. Building upon these studies and new empirical research, this Article examines fair use case law through the lens of the doctrine\'s chronological development and concludes that in fundamental ways fair use is a different doctrine today than it was ten or twenty years ago. Specifically, the Article traces the rise to prominence of the transformative use paradigm, as adopted by the Supreme Court in Campbell v. Acuff-Rose, over the market-centered paradigm of Harper &amp; Row v. The Nation and its progeny. The Article presents data showing that since 2005 the transformative use paradigm has come overwhelmingly to dominate fair use doctrine, bringing to fruition a shift towards the transformative use doctrine that began a decade earlier. The Article also finds a dramatic increase in defendant win rates on fair use that correlates with the courts embrace of the transformative use doctrine. In\' light of these developments, adding an historical dimension to a study of fair, use case law helps to make sense of what might otherwise appear to be a disconnected series of ad hoc, case-by-case judgments and explains why current rulings might seem to contradict those regarding like cases issued when the market-centered paradigm still reigned supreme.','Over the past 20 years, the U.S. fair use doctrine has altered fundamentally, including moving from a focus on commercial use to greater emphasis on transformative use.

The effect of cost structure on consumer purchase and payment intentions','Intellectual property piracy is a significant global problem and an enormous problem for U.S. companies and policymakers. This article examines why typically law-abiding people are more inclined to steal intellectual property products than more tangible, material products. The authors propose that the inclination to pay for certain types of goods and services is greater than for other types, and what distinguishes the two classes is their cost structure. They document how consumers are more or less\ninclined to pay for goods and services as a function of whether the product’s cost is principally attributable to variable cost (VC) or fixed cost (FC). The authors’ central thesis is that consumers (1)\nbelieve that they cause less harm if their failure to pay prevents a seller from recovering FC than if their failure to pay helps a seller recoup VC; (2) are more likely to risk not paying for a product the less harm they perceive that not paying would cause; and (3) therefore feel less obligated and are less likely to pay voluntarily for a high-FC, low-VC product than for a high-VC, low-FC product, when total cost and average cost are held constant. This research is particularly relevant in the information age, because it helps explain why consumers appear to be more inclined to risk stealing software and other intellectual property products with relatively high FC and little or no VC. It also allows for the creation of marketing remedies that do not involve further legal enforcement.','This research shows that:\n\n* consumers are much less intent on paying for or willing to pay less for products with relatively low variable cost (VC) and high fixed cost (FC), such as information products, than for products with a high ratio of VC to FC, such as more conventional tangible products. This may help explain why ordinarily law-abiding people are more likely to steal intangible products than material goods.\n\n* Consumers perceive failure to pay for a high-VC product as inflicting greater harm to a seller than failure to pay for a high-FC product. This is because consumers perceive amounts paid in excess of VC as a gain to the seller, and they perceive failure to cover the seller’s VC as inflicting a loss. Consumers are more likely to pay for a product the more harm they believe that not paying would cause.\n\n* This study has implications for consumer perceptions of fair price. Much of what consumers perceive as fair depends on how they believe that prices and a firm’s motive for charging prices affect firm or producer profitability. A price increase without a cost increase raises profits and is considered less fair than is a price increase associated with a cost increase.','This research may help provide alternatives to the costly enforcement associated with legal remedies by providing practical ideas for ways firms can foster greater payment intentions among consumers. A prescription for marketers (manufacturers and sellers) of high fixed products is to better communicate a more accurate representation of total costs to consumers. Another way to increase consumers’ payment and purchase intentions is simply to increase the recognizable variable cost and thus to increase the ratio of variable cost to fixed cost.','http://www.chicagobooth.edu/pdf/whyarepeoplesoprone.pdf','http://journals.ama.org/doi/pdf/10.1509/jppm.23.1.43.30398',0,0,0,'This research is comprised of 3 studies:\nStudy 1, comprised of two parts; participants in the first part of Study 1 were 128 undergraduate business students.

Theory and evidence from ebook pricing','The effective management of digital rights is the central challenge in many industries making the transition from physical to digital products. We present a new model that characterizes the value of these digital rights when products are sold both embedded in tangible physical artifacts, and as pure digital goods, and when granting rights permitted by one\'s digital rights management (DRM) platform may affect the extent of digital piracy. Our model indicates that in the absence of piracy, digital rights should be unrestricted, since a seller can use its pricing strategy to optimally balance sales between physical and digital goods. However, the threat of piracy limits the extent to which digital rights should be granted: the value of digital rights is determined not only by their direct effect on the quality of legal digital goods, but by a differential piracy effect that can lower a seller\'s pricing power. When the latter effect is sufficiently high, granting digital rights can have a detrimental effect on value - our model indicates that this kind of effect is more likely to be observed for digital rights that aim to replicate the consumption experience of physical goods, rather than enhancing a customer\'s digital experience. We test the predictions of our analytical model using data from the ebook industry.

Theory and evidence from ebook pricing','The effective management of digital rights is the central challenge in many industries making the transition from physical to digital products. We present a new model that characterizes the value of these digital rights when products are sold both embedded in tangible physical artifacts, and as pure digital goods, and when granting rights permitted by one\'s digital rights management (DRM) platform may affect the extent of digital piracy. Our model indicates that in the absence of piracy, digital rights should be unrestricted, since a seller can use its pricing strategy to optimally balance sales between physical and digital goods. However, the threat of piracy limits the extent to which digital rights should be granted: the value of digital rights is determined not only by their direct effect on the quality of legal digital goods, but by a differential piracy effect that can lower a seller\'s pricing power. When the latter effect is sufficiently high, granting digital rights can have a detrimental effect on value - our model indicates that this kind of effect is more likely to be observed for digital rights that aim to replicate the consumption experience of physical goods, rather than enhancing a customer\'s digital experience. We test the predictions of our analytical model using data from the ebook industry. Our empirical evidence supports our theoretical results, showing that four separate digital rights each have an economically significant impact on ebook prices, and establishing that the digital rights which aim to replicate physical consumption while increasing the threat of piracy are the ones that have negative impact on seller value. We also show that if the pricing of a digital good is keyed off that of an existing tangible good, optimal pricing changes for the former should be more nuanced, rather than simply mirroring changes in the price of the latter, and we discuss the effect of the technological sophistication of potential customers on optimal pricing and rights management. Our results represent new evidence of the importance of an informed and judicious choice of the different digital rights granted by a DRM platform, and provide a new framework for guiding managers in industries that are progressively being digitized.','The main results reported by the study:\n\n*In the absence of a piracy threat, digital rights are always valuable through their direct effect on increasing the quality of digital goods. Any issues of cannibalization of the sales of physical goods can be effectively addressed by a strategic choice of pricing.\n\n*When granting digital rights in the presence of digital piracy, the value of these rights is governed by two opposing effects: a direct quality effect, or how much the granting of the right increases willingness to pay for the legal digital goods, and a differential piracy effect, which measures how much the digital right reduces the relative surplus of consuming legal tangible and digital goods through inducing digital piracy.\n\n*When the direct quality effect balances the differential piracy effect, then granting the right is beneficial to the seller. It raises prices and products from the sales of digital goods. This effect is more likely to be associated with rights that enhance the digital consumption experience of the good, rather than replicate the physical consumption experience, since consumers who purchase the digital good belong to the segment who value digital quality. If they valued the physical consumption experience, these consumers would have purchased the tangible good in the first place.\n\n*When the differential quality effect associated with a digital right exceeds the direct quality effect significantly, granting the right may affect the sellers pricing power adversely, since consumers who prefer digital goods over tangible goods need to be offered sufficient surplus to ensure that they do not simply resort to using a pirated copy of the good. This kind of right is generally likely to be one that attempts to replicate the physical consumption experience digitally. \n\n*In testing the theory’s predictions using pricing and digital rights data for over 30,000 ebooks, each of four digital rights has both a statistically and economically significant impact on ebook prices, after controlling for tangible book price levels, sales rank and category. \n\n*Results also show that a right that aims to replicate physical consumption characteristics (printing) has a negative impact on ebook prices, while rights enhancing the consumption experience by exploiting the fact that the book is now a digital good (copying) have a positive impact on prices.\n \n*The variation in ebook prices observed across categories suggests that an increase in technological sophistication of consumers is associated with an increase in the price of legal digital goods.','Policy implications reported in the study:\n\n*The authors presented a model characterizing the choice of digital rights and pricing for digital goods offered by a firm that also sells a tangible version of the digital good, the granting of digital rights for which may also lead to an increase in digital piracy. The predictions of this model are validated by empirical results, and suggest important new guidelines for managers in industries that are progressively being digitized. \n\n*As the pace of industry transformation by information technology accelerates over the coming years, managing such transitions will become central to continued business success across a wider variety of industries, thereby increasing the value of research that contributes to understanding of the transformational power of IT, and of how the Internet affects markets and industry structure. \n\n*Conversations with publishers have suggested they still price the tangible book independently, and then key the ebook price of this. However, a model of the simultaneous choice of tangible and digital pricing in the presence of piracy would be a useful extension, especially as digital goods gain prominence in more industries.\n\n*While most digital goods in other industries do not currently have the rich variation in rights across products that made our empirical study of ebook pricing viable, they are likely to in the near future, and may present the opportunity for studies similar to ours across other industries like music and broadcast video. There are also indications that new forms of pricing are forthcoming in the ebook industry, most notably pay-per-use pricing from Google.','http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=871243',NULL,1,0,1,'A data set containing pricing and digital rights data for 32,092 ebook titles, across 55 categories, sold by a specialized web-based ebook retailer.

The primary objective of this research was to gather data and generate insight by establishing initial benchmarks and trends that could be used to assist policy making related to online copyright enforcement. This followed the adoption by Government of a recommendation made in the Hargreaves Review of Intellectual Property and Growth that Ofcom should not wait until its progress-reporting duties under the Digital Economy Act came into force to begin gathering trends and benchmarks related to consumption of content online.\n\nThe research universe for this study was all adults aged 12+ in the UK. The survey used a mixed methodology approach whereby data was collected using both an online and offline sample. All material relating to the main tracking study, including key findings and full technical details, can be found at:\n \nhttp://stakeholders.ofcom.org.uk/market-data-research/other/telecoms-research/copyright-infringement-tracker/ \n\nThe total sample achieved from the first two waves of the tracking study (covering the period May- October 2012) was 10,594, and this provided a robust and substantial base for the further statistical analysis in this report. The main aim of this analysis was to examine in more detail the complex relationship between general consumption, infringement, attitudes, and spend across six key content types of interest. There was a particular interest in understanding content infringers in more detail. The following streams of ‘deep dive’ analysis were undertaken:\n\n1. Decile behavioural analysis among infringers \n\nThis analysis segmented infringers into bands of 10% based on volume of content consumed illegally. This allows insight into the proportion of illegal content for which each decile of infringers is responsible. It is effectively a simple ‘behavioural’ segmentation based on the volume of infringement. In-depth profiling of the highest infringing decile groups (the top 20%) was then undertaken to allow greater understanding of high-volume infringers. \n\n2. Attitudinal segmentations amongst infringers and non-infringers \n\nIn addition to the decile behavioural analysis which segmented infringers on volume of illegal content consumed, we conducted an ‘attitudinal’ segmentation. The key inputs for this segmentation were motivations for infringing. Non-infringing consumers were also segmented separately according to their motivations for general online behaviour. Both the behavioural and the attitudinal segmentations can be used to help target groups of consumers based on their motivations. \n\n3. Infringement of multiple content types \n\nThe reports for the tracking study concentrated on general online behaviour and infringement per content type, and across all types. This extra layer of analysis was conducted in order to examine behaviour according to the number of types of content that were infringed i.e. are people actively infringing across multiple categories, and in what category combinations? \n\n4. Spend analysis among infringers \n\nAdditional analysis was undertaken to assess the complex relationship between infringement and spend on content. \nFurther details of the specific analysis methodologies employed can be found in the Technical Appendix at the end of this document.','Key findings\n\nWe conducted a series of in-depth analyses using the combined data sets from the first two waves of the Online Copyright Infringement tracking study. The purpose was to examine in more detail the complex relationship between general consumption, infringement, attitudes, and spend across six key content types. The work revealed the following:\n\n\nDecile analysis: A more detailed look at the Top 20% Infringers\n\nInfringers were segmented into 10% groups according to the overall volume of content they indicated they had accessed illegally. The main findings were as follows:\n\n* The Top 10% Infringers accounted for just 1.6% of the 12+ internet user population, but were responsible for 79% of infringed content. The Top 20% infringers, accounting for 3.2% of 12+ internet users, were responsible for 88% of infringements.\n* Infringers were more male, 16-34 and ABC1 than the general internet population. However, the Top 20% Infringers were even more likely to be male and 16-34 than the Bottom 80%. (We used the Top 20% Infringers rather than the Top 10% Infringers as the larger sample size makes comparisons more robust).\n* Despite their high levels of infringement, the Top 20% Infringers also accounted for 11% of the legal content consumed.\n* The Top 20% Infringers also spent significantly more across all content types on average than either the Bottom 80% Infringers or the non-infringing consumers (£168 vs. £105 vs. £54 over the six month period covered).\n\n\nInfringing segments\n\nAs well as segmenting by volume of content infringed, we also segmented infringers by their reasons for doing it. This resulted in four distinct infringing groups:\n\n1. Justifying Infringers (9% of infringers, 24% of infringed volume, 2% of total digital consumers):\n\nThis group had the highest levels of infringement. They felt they had spent enough on content already, and this sentiment was confirmed by their high total spend offline. Most of their digital consumption was streamed and primarily related to music, though they also consumed the highest proportion of illegal books across the segments. Generally, they like to try before they buy (related to their willingness to spend) and appear to be the most receptive to good/well-priced legal alternatives.\n\n2. Digital Transgressors (9% of infringers, 22% of infringed volume, 2% of total digital consumers):\n\nThis was the youngest infringing group, with the majority in education. They had the highest levels of downloading behaviour and had higher consumption of films and TV programmes than the other high infringing group (Justifying Infringers). This group showed the least remorse about infringing material, but also had the highest fear of getting caught. In fact, they appeared to be the most receptive to receiving letters from ISPs alleging infringement.  \n\n3. Free Infringers (42% of infringers, 35% of infringed volume, 10% of total digital consumers):\n\nThis was the largest group and was chiefly defined by the fact they infringed because it was free. They paid for a low proportion of the content they consumed and had the lowest total content spend among the infringing segments. They were responsible for the high majority of illegal consumption of video games and computer software.\n\n4. Ambiguous Infringers (39% of infringers, 20% of infringed volume, 9% of total digital consumers):\n\nThis group had the lowest levels of digital consumption and the highest proportion of paid and legal content. They generally offered fewer justifications for infringing and for stopping infringing. This appeared to be linked to their lower levels of infringing activity and a lack of confidence in knowing what is legal.\n\n* Infringers generally consumed more paid and legal content than the non-infringing segments, although this formed a lower proportion of their total consumption than it did for non-infringers.\n* Most infringing segments found it easy to find content on the internet for free which would normally be paid, ranging from 45% for the Ambiguous Infringers to 76% for the Top 20% infringers. Among non-infringers the figures were notably lower, ranging from 28% to 45%.\n\n\nNon-infringing segments\n\nAs well as segmenting the infringers, we also segmented consumers who downloaded or streamed legal content only. The four groups are summarised as follows:\n\n1. Simple Streamers (34% of legal consumers, 27% of total digital consumers):\n\nThis group was primarily defined by the fact that they only streamed content and didn’t download any. This content largely comprised TV programmes and music and was generally accessed for entertainment and convenience purposes.\n\n2. Simple Downloaders (17% of legal consumers , 13% of total digital consumers):\n\nThey were defined by the fact that they only downloaded and didn’t stream. They consumed less content than the other non-infringing segments, and largely downloaded books and music. Despite this, relatively they had the largest proportion of paid-for content.\n\n3. Paying Consumers (34% of legal consumers, 27% of total digital consumers):\n\nThis group paid for the majority of the content that they consumed, while also spending a lot on offline (such as physical) content.\n\n4. Free Opportunists (14% of legal consumers, 11% of total digital consumers):\n\n100% of this group claimed to download because it is free. They consumed a higher volume of free content than any of the other non-infringing segments.\n\n\nInfringement of multiple content types\n\nWe also analysed behaviour according to the number of types of content that were infringed.\n\n* Most people (62%) contained their infringement to only one content type of the six measured in the study, and this was predominantly music (42%) or films (28%).\n* Where there was infringement in more than one content type it generally included combinations of music, films and TV programmes. Infringement of computer software and video games was more prevalent among those that had infringed across four or more content types.\n* Those that infringed across multiple content types also infringed a higher volume of content on average.\n* Category spend was highest for those that infringed in three content types. \n\n\nSpend analysis among infringers\n\nFurther analysis was undertaken to assess the complex relationship between infringement and spend on content, and to assess the revenue potential if infringement could be converted to legal consumption:\n\n* Generally, the data from the survey showed that as people consumed more infringed files they also consumed more legal files, and spent more on legal content.\n* Further assessment on price-sensitivity for music showed that the optimum price infringers were willing to pay (either for single downloadable tracks, or for particular premium subscriptions) generally increased as the volume of infringed content increased. (Although the optimum subscription price was below that currently charged for the first premium tier of a number of UK music streaming services, many also offer free versions, albeit with some service restrictions or limitations).\n* This optimum music price was mapped alongside banded illegal consumption in order to estimate potential additional monthly spend (lost revenue) if all infringed content was paid for at this price.\n* The data suggest that improvements to legal alternatives could potentially convert some music infringers to pay for their content (either by track or monthly) if the price was right. However, the relationship between infringement and spend is complex and the claims people make when asked questions about their likely future behaviour given changes to their options do not always closely reflect their real-life behaviour.','Interesting policy implications can be derived by the following findings:\n\n* Top 10% of infringers are responsible for almost 80% of the infringed content.\n\n* The main types of infringers are the following: justifying infringers, digital transgressors, free infringers and ambiguous infringers.\n\n* Those who do not infringe can be characterised as: simple streamers, simple downloaders, paying consumers and free opportunists.\n\n* Most of the infringement occurs in the following two industries: music and films.','http://stakeholders.ofcom.org.uk/market-data-research/other/telecoms-research/high-volume-infringers/','http://stakeholders.ofcom.org.uk/binaries/research/telecoms-research/online-copyright/deep-dive.pdf',1,0,1,'Technical appendix \n\n\nThe database used for all analysis \n\nThe database used for the analysis in this report combined data sets from the first two waves of the online copyright infringement tracker (covering the period May-October 2012).

However, the inputs here were the reasons for downloading rather than buying a physical version, and the reasons for streaming or accessing content. \n* A four- and a three-factor solution were chosen, again, on the basis of Eigen values and factor comprehension. \n* A two-stage cluster analysis was used to create the cluster seeds while the final cluster solution was created using a K-means cluster analysis. \n*A four-cluster solution was chosen on the basis of cluster membership homogeneity, and cluster heterogeneity, as well as cluster comprehension. \n* A count variable was created on respondent level data for the number of content types for which the individual consumed infringed content, using the derived illegal file calculation outline in section 3.2: \n*This was repeated for 100% illegal consumption over the different content types. \n* The attitudes and behaviours of the different platform groups were then further analysed.'),('Ofcom._(2012)','Ofcom (2012)','http://www.copyrightevidence.org/evidence-wiki/index.php/Ofcom._(2012)',2012,'OCI Tracker Benchmark Study Q3 2012 (Online)',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,0,0,0,''),('Ofcom_(2011)','Ofcom (2011)','http://www.copyrightevidence.org/evidence-wiki/index.php/Ofcom_(2011)',2011,'Qualitative research into online digital piracy','Under the Digital Economy Act, 2010, Ofcom must report progress in tackling online infringement. The overarching objective of this research project was to provide Ofcom with insight into the key drivers and motivations behind the online sharing and uploading of copyrighted material in order to further their understanding of the behaviour and attitudes displayed by file sharers. Much of the available published research in this area to date has focused on downloading activity. Ofcom therefore sought to focus this qualitative research on the uploading, rather than downloading, of unauthorised material. This report details the findings of the research with reference to the attitudes and motivations of file sharers in relation to file sharing behaviour and habits, perceptions of the risks associated with file sharing and participants’ justifications for file sharing. It also examines their awareness and understanding of the legal and potential consequences of their actions. The report ends with an exploration of a range of measures that are likely to deter people from continuing to file share in the future.','The research identified four different types of file sharers:\n* Generation file-share: who have grown up in the digital age\n* Self-serving consumers: older adults, often with families and busy lives\n* Collectors: having  passion for particular content, often niche genres\n* Cybertechies: whose file sharing is driven by technology rather than content\n\nGenerally, file sharing is viewed as a mainstream activity –\nsomething that “everyone” is doing. Under-18s most strongly believe that it is the “normal” way to access content, typically popular music singles.\n\nThere is little sense of file sharing being a “community” activity, but, contrarily, there is some evidence that altruism motivates some participants’ file sharing.\n\nMany participants are naïve about how file sharing works. In particular, younger and less tech-savvy participants are most likely not to know that using P2P file sharing sites allows others to share their own files.\n\nThose who knowingly upload files tend to feel that they should continue to do so to give something back, and to allow file sharing to continue.\n\nSome participants seem to tacitly accept that file sharing is illegal, but many others debate and justify the ethics of their activities.','Potential deterrents vary considerably for different types of file sharers:\n* The research indicates that for the more naïve and less committed file sharers, increasing their awareness of wrongdoing and highlighting the potential consequences of continuing their activities could act to deter them from further file sharing.\n* However, it is clear that the more savvy and committed file sharers will require evidence of serious consequences being faced by peers. This is likely to result in them being able to view their own activity in a different light and deter them away from file sharing.','http://stakeholders.ofcom.org.uk/binaries/research/telecoms-research/filesharing/gfk.pdf','http://stakeholders.ofcom.org.uk/binaries/research/telecoms-research/filesharing/gfk.pdf',0,0,0,'Initial desk research, followed by a qualitative opportunity sample of respondents (37 male, 10 female; age range 12 to 52) from BC1C2DE socio-economic groups in England, screened for eligibility, and stratified as mainstream, moderate or heavy file-sharers.

Close to a quarter (26%) of infringers also said they do it because it means they can try before they buy.\n\n- Factors that infringers said would encourage them to stop infringing included the availability of cheaper legal services (39%), if everything they wanted was available legally (32%) and if it was clearer what is legal and what isn’t (26%).\n\n- Regarding the threat of a letter from their Internet service provider, 22% indicated that a letter suspending their internet access would put them off, falling to 16% for a letter informing them their account had been used to infringe, and 14% for the restricting of internet speed.\n\n- Forty-four per cent of all internet users aged 12+ claimed to be either ‘not particularly confident’ or ‘not at all’ confident in terms of what is legal and what isn’t online.

IP education means the skills and competences that young people can be expected to acquire in the classroom that enable them to become familiar with intellectual property, understand its potential to generate income and economic growth and lead them to respect intellectual property rights, whether their own or those of others. The study suggests that the best approach to intellectual property education is to ensure that intellectual property skills and competences are, in the terms used by the study “transverse competences” or, more simply, that can be used across different subjects in a curriculum. It also gives examples of five learning areas selected from the eight key competencies chosen by the EU which define the main priorities for education in today´s modern economies and that provide opportunities to introduce IP in the curriculum.','* According to the responses by the ministries of education, the most fruitful areas in which to include IP education are the arts, citizenship, entrepreneurship, ICT teaching and STEM. \n\n* IP education is not a core curriculum subject, but an area of learning that lends itself to cross-curricular delivery as it is relevant to all subjects that use resource material and lead to the creation of outputs.\n\n* This study has found that many of the good practices in IP education come from private-public partnerships, in particular between commercial enterprises and relevant government ministries','* Teachers who are trained in creativity hold more positive views about IP education and have the power to unlock their students’ creative and innovative potential.

Intellectual property law has never protected comedians effectively against theft. Initially, jokes were virtually in the public domain, and comedians invested little in creating new ones. In the last half century, however, comedians have developed a system of IP norms. This system serves as a stand-in for formal law. It regulates issues such as authorship, ownership, transfer of rights, exceptions to informal ownership claims and the imposition of sanctions on norms violators. Under the norms system, the level of investment in original material has increased substantially. We detail these norms, which often diverge from copyright law\'s defaults. Our description is based on interviews with comedians, snippets of which we include throughout the paper. \n\nOur study has implications for intellectual property theory and policy. First, its suggests that the lack of legal protection for intellectual labor does not entail a market failure by necessity, as social norms may induce creativity. Second, it suggests that the rules governing a particular creative practice affect not only how much material is created, but also its kind. Third, we suggest that comedians\' IP norms system emerged over the past half century as technological change increased the benefit of having property rights in jokes and concomitantly reduced the costs of enforcing those rights. Fourth, we note that stand-up\'s norms system recognizes only a limited set of forms of ownership and transfer. We suggest that the system\'s crude rights structure is driven by the fact that effective enforcement requires that ownership be clear to the community. Lastly, social norms offer a way to regulate creative practices that do not sit well within IP law\'s one-size-fits-all mold. They do so, moreover, without imposing on society the costs of disuniformity in the formal law, including legal complexity and industry-driven lobbying. \n\nStand-up\'s norms system has both benefits and costs, which we detail in the paper. However, norms-based IP systems offer an alternative (or supplementary) cost/benefit bundle which in some cases may be superior to that of formal law alone. In stand-up\'s case, norms economize on enforcement costs and appear to maintain a healthy level of incentives to create alongside a greater diversity in the kinds of humor produced. A final assessment of stand-up\'s social norms system awaits further work. With what we currently know, we are cautiously optimistic.','# Lack of legal protection for intellectual labor does not entail a market failure by necessity, as social norms may induce creativity. \n# The rules governing a particular creative practice affect not only how much material is created, but also its kind. \n# Comedians\' IP norms system emerged over the past half century as technological change increased the benefit of having property rights in jokes and concomitantly reduced the costs of enforcing those rights. \n# Stand-up\'s norms system recognizes only a limited set of forms of ownership and transfer, driven by the fact that effective enforcement requires that ownership be clear to the community. \n# Social norms offer a way to regulate creative practices that do not sit well within IP law\'s one-size-fits-all mold, without imposing on society the costs of disuniformity in the formal law, including legal complexity and industry-driven lobbying.','Copyright does not provide adequate protection for all forms of creative expression and thus is not always necessary.

A survey of 201 respondents was used to test the model. The results indicate that individual attitudes, subjective norms, and perceived behavioral control are significant precursors to the intention to illegally copy software. In addition, punishment severity, punishment certainty, and software cost have direct effects on the individual’s attitude toward software piracy, whereas punishment certainty has a significant effect on perceived behavioral control. Consequently, strategies to reduce software piracy should focus on these factors.

The lower the cost, the less gain if it is illegally copied; by contrast, if it is very expensive, the perceived benefits of purchasing the software may be outweighed by its cost. \n* Attitude toward software piracy is clearly the strongest predictor of software piracy intention. Perceived behavioral control had the last impact on piracy intention in the proposed model.','* Influencing individuals’ attitudes toward software piracy can reinforce the subjective norms of their peers.

Theoretical possibilities to explain the social utility of this phenomenon are presented as well.','* The absence of other ICTs (PCs and the Internet in particular) which have traditionally led the way for digitalized content consumption and sharing, and the arrival of multimedia phones in Armenia have created a situation in which device convergence enables media convergence. The social harmonious nature of Armenian society may influence this convergence.\n\n* Armenian social structures related to social capital and social maintenance are also relevant to understanding social sharing. Social capital is the individual and social resources developed and made accessible through relationships and interpersonal trust among individuals in a social network.\n\n* Armenia’s challenging political situation has created an interesting use of mobile multimedia through peer-to-peer file sharing that may be used in other heated political situations. While it remains to be seen if motivations for the use of entertainment content have any relationship to motivations for the use of political information content, the skill involved in receiving, viewing and sharing the content and the political contexts for sharing otherwise censored information are there.','Further study of the motivations and social implications of peer-to-peer file sharing via mobile devices is recommended, as this will be an important contribution to the study of both smart phones and the adaptation of devices. In addition, the ways in which social capital manifests itself within a socially harmonious society (and whether this harmony-oriented culture is a traditional value compounded by socialism or is a value born from socialism) is also an interesting topic for further examination.','http://www.chicagobooth.edu/pdf/whyarepeoplesoprone.pdf','http://ijoc.org/index.php/ijoc/article/view/800',0,0,0,'Semi-structured interviews with Armenian citizens (n = 25: 15 female and 10 male, ages 16–40) were conducted through the spring and summer of 2008.

However, as we show in this paper, this negative effect may be overcompensated by a positive effect due to sampling: consumers are willing to pay more because the match between product characteristics and buyers’ tastes is improved. This indeed holds under sufficient taste heterogeneity and product diversity.\nWe present a simple multi-product monopoly model in which products are located on the Salop circle and in which consumers regard each original as superior to its copy. We first consider a model with unit demand and full participation so that any increase in revenues stems from higher prices. The property that sampling allows consumers to find a better match to their tastes, tends to lead to higher profits under file-sharing. However, there is a countervailing effect: consumers have the option to download and listen to music without paying for it. In other words, consumers have the option to simply keep the download but not to buy the song or album. This tends to make not buying a more attractive option and tends to reduce the willingness-to-pay for music. We show that the former effect dominates the latter and that the introduction of file-sharing technologies leads to higher profits if there is\nsufficient taste heterogeneity and sufficient product diversity.

Then, it builds on the author’s work in his New Architectures article, explaining who makes music, who consumes it, and why. These sections explain that while money plays a role in the marketplace for music, it is secondary to “hedonic” factors both for musicians, who make music largely for self-expressive and self-affirmation reasons, and for consumers, who listen to music for reasons including idiosyncratic perceptions of its quality, a desire to be part of a particular crowd, and vicarious identification with or attraction to the performers.\n\nThis Article then explores the essential role that intermediaries play in the marketplace. This section acknowledges that the new kinds of intermediation needed in the new technology-driven market place will not occur unless intermediaries can make money.

This suggests that the lower one travels down on the status hierarchy, the greater the variance in revenues and income.\n\n*The job of the new intermediaries is to shift the probability function to increase the likelihood of celebrity status, while not eliminating uncertainty altogether.\n\n*Copyright becomes mostly irrelevant in a market in which technology has reduced the cost of producing and distributing recorded music to near zero and competition has force prices to these near-zero costs. \n\n*Copyright still has a role to play in mitigating large-scale commercial piracy, and  trademark can play a major role in protecting the identities and personas of musicians.','Policy implications: \n\n*Advances in technology and the resulting reductions in cost make recorded music essentially free. \n\n*Record labels may insist that no business model exists for either musicians or intermediaries unless the flow of unlicensed music to consumers who do not pay anything for it is shut off, but this is incorrect.\n\n*Many very successful firms can and do compete with free.\n\n*A prescription for making a market based on free successful includes: \n\n*1. Build a community around the persona and music of a musician.\n\n*2. Involve the community in shaping the musical and other performance activities of the musician. Offer new songs free to this community and to others who might be motivated to join it.\n\n*3. Design and make available other products and activities that fans are willing to pay for. These might include more elaborate forms or mixes of the free songs, paid concerts, videos highlighting the personalities and social activities of the musicians, and special “backstage” opportunities for fans to interact with the musicians.\n\n*4.

The Cuban new media landscape is supported by informal networks that blend financial and social exchanges to circulate goods, media, and currency in ways that are often illegal but are largely tolerated. Presenting two case studies of young, educated Cubans who rely on the circulation of film and television content via external hard drives for most of their media consumption, I suggest that the emphasis of much existing literature on the role of state censorship and control in Cuban new media policy overlook the everyday practices through which Cubans are regularly engaged with Latin and U.S. American popular culture. Further, informal economies have been central to everyday life in Cuba both during the height of the Soviet socialist era and in the period since the collapse of the Soviet Union that has seen a juxtaposition of some market reforms alongside centrally planned policies. In the context of nearly two decades of economic crisis, consumer shortages and a dual economy, Cuban people use both informal and state-sanctioned networks to acquire goods ranging from groceries to furnishings and domestic appliances. Understanding the informal media economy of Cuba within this broader context helps to explain how the consumption of commercial American media is largely uncontroversial within Cuban everyday life despite the fraught politics that often dominates discussions of Cuban media policy.','The main results reported in the study:\n\n*The media landscape of Cuba is characterized by a deep connection to transnational circuits of media consumption despite official and technological isolation that limits the everyday connectivity of most Cubans to new media and information technologies.\n\n*Although Cubans complain about the dullness of nationally produced television, or about the prohibitive prices of media technologies, at the same time they engage daily in the consumption of transnational media that is either legal and state supported or largely informal or illegal but clearly tolerated by the state.\n\n*Cubans supplement their television consumption with other media, not to access entertainment that is otherwise prohibited via state broadcasting but rather to increase the hours of leisure time spent watching films and television, to “time-shift” their viewing outside the broadcast schedule, to seek out special titles or genres that are not prohibited, and to share media as a social practice by which relationships are maintained and, in some cases, profits are gained.\n\n*In the context of nearly two decades of economic crisis, consumer shortages, and a dual economy, Cuban people use both informal and state-sanctioned networks to acquire goods ranging from groceries to furnishings and domestic appliances.

Like the music, film, and publishing industries, it derives value from the creation of new, original works of authorship. But unlike rights holders in those more traditional creative industries, tattoo artists rarely assert formal legal rights in disputes over copying or ownership of the works they create. Instead, tattooing is governed by a set of nuanced, overlapping, and occasionally contradictory social norms enforced through informal sanctions. And in contrast to other creative communities that rely on social norms because of the unavailability of formal intellectual property protection, the tattoo industry opts for self-governance despite the comfortable fit of its creative output within the protections of the Copyright Act.\nThis Article relies on qualitative interview data drawn from more than a dozen face-to-face conversations with professionals in the tattoo industry. Based on those interviews, it offers a descriptive account of the social norms that have effectively displaced formal law within the tattoo community, provides a set of complementary cultural and economic explanations for the development of those norms, and outlines the broader implications of this research for intellectual property law and policy.','* The tattoo, though formally embraced by the copyright system, fits rather awkwardly in any property regime.\n\n* Although they are unlikely to express themselves in terms of property theory, tattooers see their work as a sui generis amalgam of art, commerce, and human tradition. Perhaps then, it is not entirely surprising that they have opted to regulate this unique form of expression with rules crafted and enforced within their community.\n\n* The norms tattooers have developed serve a number of overlapping purposes. They protect both the relationship between tattooer and client and the underlying assertion of personal sovereignty the tattoo represents by guaranteeing client autonomy.\n\n* The value of these norms is not confined to tattooers and their clients.

An Exploration of the Use of Legal Scholarship in Intellectual Property Decisions','The argument that the Federal Circuit is an insular court lacking in intellectual curiosity has invaded academic discourse about the court and its jurisprudence. It is rarely used as a compliment. It is rather used as an epithetic description intended to have broad explanatory power for nearly any of the many and glaring limitations that speakers and commentators contend exist in the court’s body of law. The empirical basis for the argument comes from a single finding: that between 1996 and 2000 the Second and Ninth Circuit Courts of Appeals referenced legal scholarship in their decisions in trademark and copyright cases nearly four times as often as the Federal Circuit referenced legal scholarship in its decisions in patent cases. While scholars and others have relied upon this finding to assert that the Federal Circuit’s performance is intellectually deficient, there are reasons to question whether that inference is proper. For instance, it stands in contrast to other observations that suggest the Federal Circuit behaves a lot like the regional circuits when it comes to its relationship to legal scholarship. \n\nIn this study, we explore the U.S. Supreme Court’s use of legal scholarship in its patent, trademark, and copyright jurisprudence. We report evidence of striking differences in the use of scholarship that depend on whether a decision concerns patent, trademark, or copyright law. The Court uses scholarship in patent decisions at a rate of 28%, but uses it around twice as often in its copyright (67%) and trademark (53%) decisions. While, moreover, the rates at which the Court uses legal scholarship in its copyright and trademark decisions are some of the highest observed in the Court’s entire jurisprudence, the rate at which the Court uses legal scholarship in its patent decisions is among the lowest observed. This Article discusses the significance of these observations to the empirical basis for the epithetic argument that the Federal Circuit is more insular and lacking in intellectual curiosity than other circuit courts of appeals.','This article argues against the epithetic accusation that that Federal Circuit judges are insular and lacking in intellectual curiosity. More specifically, this paper shows that: \n\n* Empirical support for the chain of reasoning linking differential citation to intellectual deficiency is weak, if not extremely weak.\n\n* Differential use of legal scholarship is a more natural phenomenon that may be unconnected, at least in many instances, from a courts intellectual connectedness to ongoing law and policy discourse.',NULL,NULL,'http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2214025',0,0,0,'The dataset includes information from all Supreme Court decisions issued between 1949 until 2009.

The sudden shutdown of the popular file hosting platform Megaupload.com on January 19, 2012 significantly (and unexpectedly) changed the availability of illegal movie downloads overnight. We compare box office revenues of movies that were available on Megaupload to those that were not pre- and post-shutdown and find that box office revenues of a majority of movies did not increase. The average effect is even negative. We show that only movies that premiere in a relatively large number of theaters benefitted from the closure of Megaupload. This is consistent with word-of-mouth effects, where online piracy can act as a mechanism to spread information about a good from consumers with low willingness to pay to consumers with high willingness to pay. This information-spreading effect of illegal downloads seems to be especially important for movies with smaller audiences, while for movies aimed at large audiences, the substitution effect between free and paid consumption weighs more heavily.','Quite surprising in light of previous empirical work, we find that box office revenues of a majority of movies that have been available on Megaupload do not increase in response to the shutdown. Indeed, the average effect of the shutdown on a movie that had previously been available on Megaupload was negative. In more differentiated analyses, we find that only movies that were on wide release in a relatively large number of theaters (blockbusters) benefited from the unavailability of Megaupload, while the effect on more narrowly released movies was neutral and even negative for niche movies. We subject these results to a number of robustness checks to rule out alternative explanations using different specifications and additional data.\nA mechanism that can explain these prima facie counterintuitive findings is that piracy generates positive externalities through information about the quality of an experience good spilling over from pirates to (potential) legal consumers. Once it becomes significantly less easy to consume pirated content online, as was the case in our empirical setting, we would expect that at least some consumers revert to legal consumption, increasing movie revenues. At the same time, the positive externalities from pirates to legal consumers vanish, so that a number of prospective legal consumers (who would pay for watching the movie) end up being less informed about specific titles, which reduces their likelihood of going to the movies. The net effect on a specific movie’s revenues then depends on how important the information externality is for the performance of this movie. Large blockbusters (i.e., wide-release movies) may be able to compensate with large advertising budgets, while word-of-mouth is likely to matter more for movies targeted at smaller audiences.','When online piracy has very different (even opposing) effects on heterogeneous products, blanket interventions aiming at reducing the negative welfare effects are difficult to implement because externalities may affect product variety and ultimately market structures. Similar to Luo (2014), who find that IP protection may affect different types of content producers differently in the market for ideas, we find that even post-release IP strategies can lead to different outcomes across heterogeneous products. Hence, “one size fits all” policies have to be assessed in all their dimensions and an overall assessment of the desired goals, which may include media diversity, sufficient niche content, but also aggregate welfare.','http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2176246','http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2176246',1,0,1,'The study uses weekly revenues of a set of movies in a variety of countries in 2011 and 2012 from Boxofficemojo, a commercial provider of industry statistics, and obtained data on a movie’s availability on Megaupload by accessing archived versions of the linking website Movie2k.to.

Allowing for a second source of revenues apart from record sales, we show that piracy can hurt some artists while benefiting others. Under plausible assumptions, piracy is beneficial to the most popular artists. However, this\ndoes not carry over to less popular artists, who are often harmed by piracy.

Our findings generalize a result found in a different setup by Gayer and Shy (2006). Like them, we show that piracy is beneficial to popular artists when side revenues are important. However, in our model this does not necessarily carry over to less popular artists: under plausible conditions on the parameters governing quality degradation and copying costs, these artists are harmed by piracy, and this can occur even when side revenues are large enough for piracy to benefit popular artists. Therefore, we have argued that piracy may be bad for social welfare since in the long run it may reduce musical variety. To conclude, let us briefly note that this negative result is mitigated when piracy, through its effect on recognition, has a positive impact on the probability of a relatively unpopular artist to become a star, as in Alcalá and González-Maestre (2010), which is likely to be the case in the presence of imperfections in the talent revelation process (Terviö, 2009, see).','* Piracy is not necessarily bad for the creators of music.\n* The most successful artists are likely to feel the least effect of piracy.\n* This means that less successful and newer artists feel more effect from piracy and this may be a barrier to joining the industry, leading to lower social welfare for consumers who will have less choice in the musicians available.',NULL,'http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0167624512000030',1,0,1,'This study is a literature review and refers to previous empirical studies and economic models on the effects of file sharing on the music industry.

Today, there is the growing importance of intellectual property and copyright protection for authors and creators of literary, dramatic, musical, artistic and other intellectual works. The digital age has placed added pressure on songwriters, lyricists and composers in their ability to derive economic benefits from their intellectual creativity in the form of a copyright. Copyright laws protect and enable the creation of music by allowing authors and composers to license the control and use of their creations, and receive compensation in the form of royalty payments for their work. The PROs license, collect and distribute royalty payments for non-dramatic public performances of copyrighted musical works created and owned by its members or affiliates. In this paper, skewness and heavy tail of returns in the form of member royalty payments are estimated using the skew-normal and skew-t distributions in a parametric approach. We found strong evidence of the so-called ‘superstar effect’ in which the average royalty payment made by a PRO is still dominated by extreme outcomes, and relatively few members earned a substantial share of royalty payments from blockbuster hits that have endured over time. There is little evidence of smaller niche members dominating or replacing the ‘superstars.’ Economists and others will benefit from this empirical study which emphasizes a new understanding of the music industry from a PRO, member royalty payment and performance copyright perspective.','Data from ASCAP on distribution of earnings.','The fact that only few members of the Performing Rights Organization (PRO) receive the lion\'s share of benefits, should be considered when designing policies regarding artists royalties.','http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10824-010-9123-1',NULL,0,0,0,''),('Plouffe_(2008)','Plouffe (2008)','http://www.copyrightevidence.org/evidence-wiki/index.php/Plouffe_(2008)',2008,'Examining \"peer-to-peer\" (P2P) systems as consumer-to-consumer (C2C) exchange','Purpose – The exchange of goods between individual consumers being facilitated by the internet and “peer-to-peer” (P2P) systems is severely altering the business landscape. In broader terms, P2P exchanges are a form of what has occasionally been labeled “consumer-to-consumer” (C2C) exchange. What little work there is in business research which has examined both C2C and P2P exchange has to-date been largely anecdotal or conceptual. This paper aims to address these shortcomings.\nDesign/methodology/approach – A model of antecedents germane to the P2P phenomenon is formulated and empirically tested which includes the consumer’s satisfaction with, extent of usage of, and future behavioral intentions toward P2P exchanges as the focal endogenous constructs of interest.\nFindings – The model is tested with perceptual and archival data from a survey of consumers active in one prevalent form of P2P exchange (i.e. the “swapping” of pirated music). The model explains significant variance in all three focal endogenous constructs.\nResearch limitations/implications – The primary limitations include the study’s exploratory nature and not being able to incorporate all potentially salient constructs and variables germane to the P2P phenomenon within the context of the study reported here. Additionally, and from a sampling perspective, a more heterogeneous sample may benefit future research.\nPractical implications – The key insight emerging from the work is that the wide prevalence of P2P exchanges occurring globally between consumers has more to do with unexplored aspects of the phenomenon (such as its convenience; the “connectedness” it makes consumers feel to others) and seemingly much less to do with traditional marketing mix variables.\nOriginality/value – While much has been written in the practitioner ranks and popular press about the problem of P2P exchanges, this work represents one of the first empirical studies of the antecedent drivers of the phenomenon. As is articulated in the paper’s concluding sections, from a more embracing frame of reference, P2P systems and “consumer-to-consumer” exchanges are not the dire threats many marketing managers believe them to be. Challenges remain, however, for marketers to determine how to best harness these powerful new systems.','* Thinking in broader terms about our findings and the P2P phenomenon, a transformation of a seemingly irreversible nature has occurred with the advent of P2P systems which has titled the power inherent in the exchange relationship into the consumer’s favor within key consumption categories.\n\n* The rise of P2P exchange also signals that the consumer’s unfettered acceptance of traditional consumption formats, distribution modalities, and pricing systems is waning. For example, many consumers no longer want product components which they find unappealing or wasteful (e.g. unliked songs on a music CD).\n\n* In short, P2P systems seem to have provided the technological foundation and impetus for consumers to do what anecdotal accounts have strongly signaled they have wanted to do for some time – that being to consume certain categories of goods a-la-carte, in ways which best suit their specific lifestyles and individual tastes.\n\n* From a management perspective, the implication is that media-oriented businesses (e.g. music, film, software etc.) appear stuck in the conundrum that they are legacy industries intricately linked to neoclassic economic models of exchange and distribution – and the assumptions upon which they are predicated.','P2P systems simultaneously represent both an unprecedented threat and a tremendous opportunity for marketers in specific industries (Bloom, 2005). Thinking more clearly about both the experiential drivers (i.e. the individual’s past experience with technology in general, and P2P systems more specifically) as well as salient individual-level perceptual constructs (e.g. the “convenience” and “community connectedness” P2P systems confer) will better enable marketers to successfully harness these powerful technologies in specific consumption modalities and industries\n(Denegri-Knott et al., 2006).','https://datapro.fiu.edu/campusedge/files/articles/plouffec1711.pdf','http://www.emeraldinsight.com/doi/abs/10.1108/03090560810903637',0,0,0,'After providing an overview of the project to several large entry-level marketing classes (total n=345) at a Carnegie I research university, all interested students provided their name and a preferred email address.

The objective has been to arrive at a set of reasonable projected costs for the Digitisation of Europe’s cultural heritage. It should be recognised from the outset that there can be no single definitive answer to this question. Digitisation is a process, and as with any process the actual cost depends both on the organisational context, the complexity of the material and the sophistication of the output','* The estimated total cost of digitising the collections of Europe’s museums, archives and libraries, including the audiovisual material they hold is approximately €100bn, or €10bn per annum for the next 10 years, factoring in a cumulative efficiency gain of 0.5% per annum.\n\n* The cost of preserving and providing access to this material over a 10-year period after Digitisation would be in the order of €10bn to €25bn, provided that centralised repository infrastructure is made available for the purpose.\n\n* The Research & Development Budget for the Joint Strike Fighter programme is estimated at €40.34bn.\n\n* It would cost between 10% and 40% of the Joint Strike Fighter R&D budget to digitise every eligible title in Europe’s libraries.\n\n* The cost of delivering one Joint Strike Fighter is €147.41m, equivalent to the cost of digitising 1.93m books, or 2-3% of all individual titles held in libraries.\n\n* The cost of delivering 100km of main road in Europe is €750m. 100km of main road is equivalent to the cost of digitising every piece of audio content in EU cultural institutions, or 48% of the total holdings of video (excluding film). 100km of main road would pay for the digitisation of up to 16% of all available books in EU libraries, or 40% of the historic photographs in EU cultural institutions.','* Mass-Digitisation is an industrial process, and hence is very susceptible to efficiency gains at scale. Broadly, the larger a Digitisation project becomes, the lower the unit cost of Digitisation due to the dispersal of overhead and upfront capital costs over a larger body of material.\n* Digitisation naturally tends towards greater efficiency over time. Hence the work-rate of a Digitisation facility at the start of a 10-year project is significantly lower than towards the end. This is not only due to the increased technical competence of the people involved, but also the gradual refinement and streamlining of workflow over the period of the project. This effect has been noted even in 3-year projects, with a significant majority of the Digitisation completed during the project lifetime being completed in the 3rd year.\n\n* Due to natural market forces and the increasing presence of low-cost, high-volume Digitisation services in India and the Far East, the unit cost of Digitisation provided by 3rd party services has decreased significantly over the past 10 years.\n\n* The Return on Investment in large-scale Digitisation tends to be higher where there is ongoing strategic investment in Digitisation as a core activity of the cultural institution, rather than as a project-funded activity. This is due to the significant efficiency gain that arises from long-term practice and the development of tacit institutional knowledge and expertise leading to more effective prioritisation and decision-making.\n\n* As with physical collections, the acquisition of digital material creates a long-term obligation on the host institution, which must be accounted for. Most estimates put the cost of preserving and providing access to a digital asset for a period of 10 years at 50-100% of the initial costs of creating it. Hence, mass-Digitisation creates a large-scale economic obligation which must be addressed from the outset in programme budgets. \n\n* When considering mass-Digitisation and text-conversion/encoding of books, it is important to factor into the value equation not only the potential value of the assets themselves, but also the considerable value of the new knowledge and information associated with them (such as the new insight into language development gained by Google as a result of the Google Book Search project).','http://nickpoole.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/digiti_report.pdf','http://nickpoole.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/digiti_report.pdf',1,0,1,'The survey regarded 45 National Libraries in the Council of Europe, 17673 museums in the EU, 25 National archives in the European Union, 10.81 million hours of audio in EU cultural institutions, and 12.14 million hours of video in EU cultural institutions.'),('Poort_and_Leenheer_(2012)','Poort and Leenheer (2012)','http://www.copyrightevidence.org/evidence-wiki/index.php/Poort_and_Leenheer_(2012)',2012,'File sharing 2©12: Downloading from illegal sources in the Netherlands','This report presents the results of a consumer survey on the downloading and streaming of music, films, TV series and programmes, games and books.

As a consequence, imports have become cheaper, to the point that we have seen deflation across a range of imported products, and a continued decline in Australia’s copyright industry manufacturing base.\n#Many copyright products (e.g. music, movies, games, software, books, newspapers, etc) are continuing to move from physical distribution to electronic distribution, enabling the disintermediation of the supply chain (e.g. lessening the need for a physical retail presence) as consumers have shifted their consumption to digital versions and online delivery\n#There has been an increased risk of unauthorised copying because of the low cost of reproduction of perfect digital copies. Indeed the value of the production of unauthorised copyright products is not included even though they should possibly be considered part of the copyright industries.\n\nIn this changing and challenging environment there is a continued need for copyright industries to develop, supported by copyright law, which provides certainty and the incentive to innovate and grow.','This study shows that Australia’s copyright industries - many of which are undergoing significant change to their traditional business models as they continue to embrace digitisation - continue to be a key piece of infrastructure which support the Australian economy. In the most recent year for which data is available (2013-14), Australia’s copyright industries:\n*Generated economic value of $111.4 billion, the equivalent of 7.1 per cent of gross domestic product (GDP), which is greater than the manufacturing and health care sectors. \n\nWhile still significant, growth in Australia’s copyright industries has been challenged in recent years:\n*Over the period 2001-02 to 2007-08 the real (i.e. inflation adjusted) compound annual growth rate (CAGR) for value add generated by copyright industries was 3.7 per cent, with the core copyright industries growing 3.2 per cent per year.\n* Over the subsequent period 2008-09 to 2013-14 the real value add CAGR for all copyright industries was zero per cent, and 0.3 per cent for the core copyright industries.\n*Employed just over 1 million people, which constituted 8.7 per cent of the Australian workforce. On average, copyright industry jobs are relatively well paid: the real average wage for people employed in the copyright industries has also increased from $59,500 in 2004-05 to $68,960 per employee in 2013-14 .\n*Generated just over $4.8 billion in exports, equal to 1.8 per cent of total exports. The relative value of copyright exports has declined as a proportion of total exports in recent years.\nIn this regard, Australia’s copyright industries continue to be a significant contributor to the Australian economy and our current and future national prosperity.','Copyright industries should be encouraged legally and financially due to the rising and substantial contribution to the Australian economy.','http://www.copyright.org.au/acc_prod/ACC/Research_Papers/The_Economic_Contribution_of_Australia_s_Copyright_Industries_2002-2014.aspx','http://www.copyright.org.au/acc_prod/ACC/Research_Papers/The_Economic_Contribution_of_Australia_s_Copyright_Industries_2002-2014.aspx',0,0,0,'This report analyzes the economic contribution of Australia\'s copyright industries over 12 years, using WIPO\'s classification of copyright industries: core, partial, interdependent, and non-dedicated support.'),('PricewaterhouseCoopers_(2016)','PricewaterhouseCoopers (2016)','http://www.copyrightevidence.org/evidence-wiki/index.php/PricewaterhouseCoopers_(2016)',2016,'Understanding the costs and benefits of introducing a ‘fair use’ exception','The Australian Law Reform Commission report recommended that the Copyright Act should be amended to introduce a new copyright exception, based on the United States ‘fair use’ exception, which would allow the use of copyright material for any purpose if the use is ‘fair’ having regard to four factors. The ALRC’s recommendation in favour of fair use is based predominantly on a legal analysis and did not include an economic cost-benefit analysis (CBA). From an economic perspective it is clear that they may be new disincentives to create works with the introduction of a \'fair use\' provision. As a result, the core task of this analysis is to determine, based on the available evidence, whether it is likely that the economic benefits arising from secondary use will more than offset the economic loss for original local producers. This report provides some insights into elements that should be considered in any formal CBA of the proposed introduction of fair use.\n\nDisclaimer: This Report was prepared for APRA AMCOS, PPCA, Copyright Agency│Viscopy, Foxtel, News Corp Australia and Screenrights.

The resulting loss of economies of scale would lead to an increase in transaction costs, compliance costs and enforcement costs.\nBoth quantitative analyses suggest that there is no firm evidence supporting a direct causational relationship between fair use and improved economic outcomes for the Australian economy as a whole; the linkages between economic growth and innovation are likely a confluence of factors that interact to support a country’s economic outcomes.','Both quantitative analyses suggest that there is no firm evidence supporting a direct causational relationship between fair use and improved economic outcomes for the Australian economy as a whole; the linkages between economic growth and innovation are likely a confluence of factors that interact to support a country’s economic outcomes.','http://www.pc.gov.au/__data/assets/pdf_file/0010/195850/sub133-intellectual-property-attachment.pdf','http://www.pc.gov.au/__data/assets/pdf_file/0010/195850/sub133-intellectual-property-attachment.pdf',0,0,0,'This study uses World Bank economic data combined with Consumers International rankings, collected for research conducted by Lateral Economics, the Standing Committee of Legal and Constitutional Affairs, and PricewaterhouseCoopers.

And with most on-line collections, web visitors are able to see the items while using enhanced searching and browsing capabilities to find them. This capability expands the usability of the on-line collections in ways traditional finding aids and box lists cannot match. There is a wealth of interesting and helpful material in most libraries - and as long as items are truly historic (19th Century and before) and without literary or copyright claims, the process of creating online collections is straightforward. Find the items, scan them, provide access: more primary resources on the web (though the process is a little more complicated than that). Creating an online resource for more recent historical documents (i.e., created or published less than 78 years ago) adds another large layer of difficulty to the task.\nThe Digital Scriptorium at Duke University creates on-line projects for a variety of collections, ranging from ancient papyri to 20th-Century photography. For the most part, everything that has been made available by the Scriptorium has either been out of copyright or, in the case of the photos, the library owns the copyright to the items themselves. \nThe Ad*Access project, however, presented an entirely new challenge. Ad*Access, an on-line database, gives researchers around the world images and information for more than 7,000 advertisements printed primarily in U.S. newspapers and magazines between 1911 and 1955. It is the collaborative effort of the Digital Scriptorium and the John W. Hartman Center for Sales, Advertising & Marketing History. Generously supported by the Duke Endowment \"Library 2000\" Fund, Ad*Access was created using materials in the J. Walter Thompson Company Competitive Advertisements Collection. \nThe vast majority of the advertisements chosen for this project were created and published after 1923. Clearly beyond the copyright-free zone, the library had to answer the question of whether the pursuit of copyright permission was necessary, as the project was created by an educational institution for research and study. In other words, did the project fall within fair use? \nThis article describes how that decision was made and the implications of that decision. The author includes citations from copyright law and other resources dealing with intellectual property and fair use. The author, however, is NOT a lawyer, and does not purport to offer legal advice in any way. The emphasis of the article is to describe our project\'s efforts in resolving the question of copyright for Ad*Access.','The development of copyright law in relation to the Internet and image archives is still that: developing. If and when the courts are presented with test cases in this area, the clarified understanding of fair use in connection with web-based archival collections will hopefully allow an increase in the exhibits of items still within copyright. Until that point, the experience gained from the Ad*Access project assists in the consideration of other on-line exhibits to be produced by the Digital Scriptorium at Duke University.','The ambiguity of the copyright status of the advertisements being digitised meant how to proceed with the project was unclear.\nThe advertisements in Ad*Access may never have been covered under copyright. The items may have been viewed by their creators as ephemeral and not worth registering with the Copyright Office; therefore, the pursuit of permissions for this project may not have been entirely legally necessary. The goodwill and positive responses generated by our communications with the many companies, however, was worth the time and effort of the process. The Hartman Center interacts with hundreds of companies which use the Center\'s resources. Engendering a negative name within this community would be counterproductive. Additionally, the two fundamental exclusive rights of copyright, i.e. the reproduction right and the representation right, remain operative; yet the way in which they now interact and accumulate in a networked environment is undeniably uncharted legal territory.','http://www.dlib.org/dlib/february00/pritcher/02pritcher.html','http://www.dlib.org/dlib/february00/pritcher/02pritcher.html',0,0,0,'This article details the process of digitising a collection of advertisements for an online publicly available database in the United States.

The research arose primarily from the recommendations of the Hargreaves Review which was quite explicit in pointing to orphan works as a major problem of untapped resources in the UK.  \n\nWithin this context the aims of the study were to carry out some qualitative research in the UK\nwith organisations that had an interest in orphan works and had previously been consulted by\nIPO. The main aim was to consult on the views of interested parties and in particular discuss\nthe perceived benefits, disbenefits, and changes in use patterns from their perspective.  In parallel with this research, IPO has commissioned further research on the use of orphan works schemes and pricing issues which has been carried out by Bournemouth University.\n\nAt the time of the research the details of potential proposals to be put forward by the Government\nfor an orphan works scheme were not known in full, but there had been consultations as part of\nthe Hargreaves Review and subsequently. Hence the results are qualified by this, and need to\nbe viewed in this context.','The interviews with organisations in the UK showed that by and large they supported the introduction of an orphan works system. The small group that did not, considered that it would be too costly to administer, and that the costs would outweigh the benefits. There were considered to be benefits in terms of the competitiveness of businesses, especially for the smaller ones (where the cost of accessing material would be reduced, coupled with an increase in the supply) and firms in the media, TV, film and publicity sectors. Hence, there could be wider economic benefits and some stimulation of growth. The main benefits to society were considered to be increased access to materials, training and educational benefits. The disbenefits were potentially that the system could be too complex and cumbersome, and licenses could take too long to be issued. It was considered that there would be an increase in demand for orphan work material.\n\nThe main economic benefits were considered to be increases in competitiveness, income and\nrevenue, especially for the media sector. The main benefits to society were through the increase\nin access to material which improved education and training, and the choice of services for the\npublic.\n\nOverseas organisations did not identify many disbenefits. The main ones were that the process\nto obtain use could take too long, and the system could be complex. The issue of legal\nchallenges was not raised as a disbenefit. The orphan works systems had increased the supply of useable materials primarily because of a reduced risk of copyright infringement, and greater certainty and confidence. There was very little difference in the perceived benefits and disbenefits of systems overseas, as compared to the potential UK system, based on the perceptions of the organisations in these countries.','As a result of its research, the Review found that the orphan work problem results in large quantities of copyright works being effectively unavailable for use, whether for cultural or commercial purposes. Therefore it was recommended that the government should legislate to enable licensing of orphan works.\nThe government accepted this recommendation and as part of a potential solution, recognised the need for further research and views.','https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/orphan-works-in-the-uk-and-overseas','https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/orphan-works-in-the-uk-and-overseas',1,0,1,'Semi-structured interviews were conducted with 26 UK organisations and 26 international organsiations with an interest in orphan works legislation (Government agencies, Industry representative bodies, or collecting societies, with the remainder being a mix of education, community bodies, and museums/archives).'),('Quiring,_Von_Walter_and_Atterer_(2008)','Quiring, Von Walter, and Atterer (2008)','http://www.copyrightevidence.org/evidence-wiki/index.php/Quiring,_Von_Walter_and_Atterer_(2008)',2008,'Can filesharers be triggered by economic incentives? Results of an experiment','Illegal filesharing on the internet leads to considerable financial losses for artists and copyright owners as well as producers and sellers of music. Thus far, measures to contain this phenomenon have been rather restrictive. However, there are still a considerable number of illegal systems, and users are able to decide quite freely between legal and illegal downloads because the latter are still difficult to sanction. Recent economic approaches account for the improved bargaining position of users. They are based on the idea of revenue-splitting between professional sellers and peers. In order to test such an innovative business model, the study reported in this article carried out an experiment with 100 undergraduate students, forming five small peer-to-peer networks. The networks were confronted with different economic conditions. The results indicate that even experienced filesharers hold favourable attitudes towards revenue-splitting. They seem to be willing to adjust their behaviour to different economic conditions.','* As a partial result,it can be noted that distinct differences exist in the care invested in choosing download material between those users who have no costs whatsoever for a download,and those who have to pay.This result indicates that under real conditions,not all files which are downloaded illegally from the internet would be saleable.Therefore,on no account can the number of illegally-acquired files be treated as commensurate with music industry losses.The reason why there are no significant differences between those groups with different payment conditions lies,among other things,in the experimental design,which had to allow for restrictions to the duration of the simulation period and the consistent budget of €75.Certainly,studies over a longer period of time with variable budgets would yield more vivid results.\n\n* Differences between the groups can provide clues as to the effect of economic incentives on users’willingness to cooperate in an anticipatory manner.While downloads from the commercial provider do not lead to financial gains for any participating user,the users in groups 25:75, 50:50 and 75:25 profited from downloads by other users.Therefore,the tests on group differences can be looked upon as rough partial tests of the distribution revenue model.\n\n* Looking at the users’interactions,there are several indications that social norms are at work:a closer inspection of the log file data reveals that almost all users in the revenue-sharing conditions began the simulation period by immediately buying songs from the commercial provider,i.e.they spent (virtual) money in order to establish a common basis for further exchange.After a very short period of time (about three minutes in each condition) they began to download songs from other participants without being addressed by them first.It can be assumed that they did so because they believed that other users would download from their account in the future.','* .This study confirms that users – at least under experimental conditions – show a willingness to cooperate and take future profits of their own into account.The strategy observed in the experiment more or less resembles the cooperation part of the ‘tit for tat’strategy well known from game theory (Axelrod,1990).In the long run,all users benefit from a cooperative strategy,as they would miss out on financial benefits if they did not cooperate.Therefore,a cooperative strategy can be regarded as the most effective choice economically.Moreover,these systems could be interesting for users who want to make a profit by building up an extensive database in order to resell their files.\n\n* According to the authors, the explorative study has severe limitations and only parts of the theoretical ideas discussed above are covered by the data.It was unable to investigate a number of factors that also might have a decisive impact on user behaviour. Further experimental research might consider factors such as unlimited time,a larger number of participants,the integration of chatrooms,new ways of distribution (including cellphones and personal digital assistants (PDAs)),real budgets and real songs.While the participants more or less behaved according to the theoretical idea in a 30-minute simulation period,long-term online experiments might clarify whether or not some users drop out of the system because they are never addressed, while other users emerge as new big players within the system. In this context it would be interesting to see how other users’attitudes towards new big players develop.','https://epub.ub.uni-muenchen.de/15619/1/can_filesharers.pdf','http://nms.sagepub.com/content/10/3/433.short',0,0,0,'To reproduce the five different revenue-sharing conditions (100:0,75:25, 50:50,25:75,0:0),the sample of 100 undergraduate students was divided into five groups of 20 participants.Each group simulated a small peer-to-peer network.Participants were recruited via a web form where they filled in their address,age,gender and download affinity.The five experimental groups were matched according to these three criteria (age,gender,download affinity).'),('Rainie_and_Madden_(2004)','Rainie and Madden (2004)','http://www.copyrightevidence.org/evidence-wiki/index.php/Rainie_and_Madden_(2004)',2004,'Preliminary findings from a web survey of musicians and songwriters','Between March 15 and April 15 of this year, 2,755 musicians and songwriters responded to a Web-based survey about the way they use the Internet and their views on a host of public policy questions related to copyright and music file-sharing on the Internet.

The InfoSoc Directive introduced minimum levels of copyright protection without setting standards for the protection of the public’s and users’ interests. As a consequence, the implementation of the InfoSoc Directive has not led to the EU-wide harmonisation of copyright sought by many parties. In particular, the optional nature of most copyright exceptions and limitations and the failure to limit the scope of protection of copyright and related rights to those outlined in the directive, has led to continuing fragmentation of national copyright laws among Member States.\nThe Commission’s consultation on the copyright reform provides a thorough picture of the change of context of copyright in the digital age, and reveals the most pressing problems met by many stakeholders in their everyday usage of copyright.','* The fragmentation of EU copyright law and the resulting lack of transparency are well understood by the Commission, and are reflected in the Commission’s intention to break down ‘national silos’ in copyright legislation.

Thus, at the outset of the negotiations that led to  the formation of the Berne Convention in 1884, the distinguished Swiss delegate Numa Droz  stated that it should be remembered that “limits to absolute protection are rightly set by the  public interest.”2  In consequence, from the original Berne Act of 1886,3 the Berne  Convention has contained provisions granting latitude to member states to limit the rights of  authors in certain circumstances.  In keeping with this approach, the present international  conventions on authors’ and related rights contain a mixture of limitations and exceptions on  protection that may be adopted under national laws.  These can be grouped, very roughly,  under the following headings:\n\n1.  Provisions that exclude, or allow for the exclusion of, protection for particular  categories of works or material.  \n\n2. Provisions that allow for the giving of immunity (usually on a permissive, rather than  mandatory, basis) from infringement proceedings for particular kinds of use, for example,  where this is for the purposes of news reporting or education, or where particular conditions  are satisfied. \n\n3. By provisions that allow a particular use of copyright material, subject to the payment  of compensation to the copyright owner. \n\nThe juridical and policy basis for each kind of provision is different.  The first proceeds  on the assumption that there are clear public policy grounds that copyright protection should  not exist in the works in question, for example, because of the importance of the need for  ready availability of such works from the point of view of the general public.  The second  represents a more limited concession that certain kinds of uses of works that are otherwise  protected should be allowed:  there is a public interest present here that justifies overriding the  private rights of authors in their works in these particular circumstances.  In the third category  of cases, the author’s rights continue to be protected but are significantly abridged:  public  interest still justifies the continuance of the use, regardless of the author’s consent, but subject  to the payment of appropriate remuneration.  Instances of all three kinds of provisions are to  be found in each of the conventions that are the subject of the present study, although they are  most developed in the case of the Paris Act of Berne.  For the most part, they are not made  mandatory, but are left as matters for the national legislation of member states to determine  for themselves, albeit usually within strict boundaries that are set by the provision in question.','Not stated.','http://www.wipo.int/edocs/mdocs/copyright/en/sccr_9/sccr_9_7.pdf','http://www.wipo.int/edocs/mdocs/copyright/en/sccr_9/sccr_9_7.pdf',0,0,0,'Legal analysis of the limitations and exceptions in five major international copyright treaties.'),('Rietveld_(2015)','Rietveld (2015)','http://www.copyrightevidence.org/evidence-wiki/index.php/Rietveld_(2015)',2015,'Value Creation from Complements in Platform Markets Studies on the Video Game Industry','This dissertation is comprised of three empirical studies that examine the effect of platform-level variation on value creation strategies and market performance for providers of complementary goods (“complementors”) in platform-based markets. The studies all investigate the video game industry as a canonical example of a platform market. Three empirical studies are preceded by an industry chapter outlining the evolution of the video game industry as perceived by one of the industry’s key actors: Nintendo.','* New IP is a binary variable that takes the value of 1 if a video game is based on a new IP and 0 otherwise. 29% of all video games in the sample are based on new IP. Thee statistic corresponds with generally accepted statistics of non-imitative or really new innovations in a market. Figure 3.2 displays the distribution of video game introductions per platform and the ratio of new IP introductions by platform maturity. The figure illustrates that, across different levels of platform maturity, there is sufficient variance in terms of the number of games entering each platform as well as the ratio of video games that are based on new intellectual property.\n\n* There exists a concave curvilinear effect of platform maturity on complement sales. As the number of late platform adopters increases, the positive effect of indirect network effects is mitigated by differences in late adopters’ characteristics and behavior. Moreover, these differences do not affect all types of complements equally. First, late adopters increasingly shy away from choosing innovative complements in favor of non-novel ones. Platform maturity thus amplifies the sales disparity between innovative and non-novel complements. Secondly, late adopters increasingly congregate around superstar complements amplifying the skewness between popular and less popular complements on the platform. \n\n* Two auxiliary findings are that there exist positive indirect network effects and negative same side network effects in the market for console video games. An additional game entering the platform has a negative effect on cumulative unit sales for games launched in the subsequent month. The latter result adds support to the “competitive crowding” hypothesis of direct network effects for complements in platform markets (Boudreau, 2012; Wareham et al., 2014). The finding is consistent with Venkatraman and Lee (2004) who conclude that video game developers are less likely to enter crowded video game platforms. Additionally, the finding aligns with Boudreau et al. (2011) who find that the effect of adding competitors in the context of innovation contest platforms is contingent on the uncertainty and nature of the challenge. In a split-sample analysis comparing innovative with less novel games, the author found that the negative effect of competitive crowding is stronger for innovative games.','* How does platform maturity affect the adoption of complements? Taking a demand-side perspective, the author argued that the shifting composition of end-users on the platform moderates the extent to which complements enjoy indirect network effects. The benefit of a growing installed base is juxtaposed by late adopters’ adoption pattern of complements. \n\n*In the study of sixth generation console video games in the United Kingdom, the author found that platform maturity has a concave curvilinear effect on complements’ adoption rates.

Its success has revealed a community of hackers that have attempted to circumvent the exclusive arrangement that Apple shares with AT&T for cellular telephone service. Unfortunately for Apple (and similarly situated manufacturers), intellectual property doctrines and laws do not prevent consumers from altering their products so as to circumvent relationships that manufacturers may have with others. Manufacturers inevitably lose capacity to control the product as a result of the sale of specific units. The doctrines of first sale in both patent and copyright law prevent manufacturers from controlling consumer manipulation of the object after the sale has been completed. Additionally, the Digital Millennium Copyright Act\'s anti-circumvention provision does not necessarily apply to prevent consumers from altering firmware within a product. Manufacturers are increasingly turning to alternatives to intellectual property to secure control over the device after the sale. One such alternative is the exclusion of warranty under Article 2 of the Uniform Commercial Code, for aberrant consumers.\n\nThis article considers whether limitation of warranties may actually have the deterrence effect on consumers that manufacturers desire; said differently, the article weighs whether manufacturers can achieve their goals of preventing consumers from using their products in an unauthorized manner by removing warranty protections from the consumer. The Article presents a behavioral model based on the Triandis\' model of planned behavior and enhances the model by accounting for likely and unlikely benefits and detriments. The model suggests that participants weigh the detrimental impact together with the probability and magnitude of the detriment against the beneficial impact together with the probability and magnitude of the benefit when making the decision to engage in technological piracy. Considering only half of the equation - what deterrents are likely to impact consumer behavior - the Article then reconciles the model to empirical evidence suggesting that Apple\'s warranty could be a stronger deterrent for consumers than civil liability.\n\nThe data collected suggests four observations of the survey pool: (1) known sanctions reduce the preference for engaging in technology piracy; (2) persons surveyed believe they are more likely to lose a warranty than face civil liability for engaging in technological piracy; (3) a better warranty enhances the magnitude of the warranty\'s benefit, and therefore raises the level of deterrence to nearly equal the deterrence level of civil liability; and (4) the magnitude, probability, and deterrent impact of both deterrents can be enhanced if consumer knowledge is improved. The article concludes that manufacturers can better protect their post-sale investment in property by raising consumer awareness of their warranty\'s quality and by raising awareness of the consequences for using the product in a way that is outside the terms of the consumers\' authorized use.','* Known sanctions reduce the preference for engaging in technology piracy. \n* Persons surveyed believe they are more likely to lose a warranty than face civil liability for engaging in technological piracy.\n* A better warranty enhances the magnitude of the warranty\'s benefit, and therefore raises the level of deterrence to nearly equal the deterrence level of civil liability\n* The magnitude, probability, and deterrent impact of both deterrents can be enhanced if consumer knowledge is improved.','Manufacturers can better protect their post-sale investment in property by raising consumer awareness of their warranty\'s quality and by raising awareness of the consequences for using the product in a way that is outside the terms of the consumers\' authorized use.','http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1351967','http://scholarship.law.duke.edu/dltr/vol9/iss1/17/',0,0,0,'Online surveys sent through Facebook to users reflective of Apple\'s target market in two pools, university students and general public.

It also substantially undermines conceptions of the doctrine that are hostile to fair use claims by commercial entities and that would restrict limit the application of fair use as a subsidy or a redistributive tool favoring the politically and economically disadvantaged.

Although the effect is not as large as was transformative use, there is clear evidence confirming that partial copying weighs in favor of the defendant’s assertion of fair use. \n\n*It is also apparent from the data that there are many strong cases of fair use involving copying the entirety of the plaintiff’s work.

It also presents new evidence of the association between this form of litigation and allegations of infringement concerning pornographic films. Multi-defendant John Doe lawsuits have become the most common form of copyright litigation in several U.S. districts, and in districts such as the Northern District of Illinois, copyright litigation involving pornography accounts for more than half of new cases filed.\n\nThis Article highlights a fundamental oversight in the extant literature on copyright trolls. Paralleling discussions in patent law, scholars addressing the troll issue in copyright have applied status-based definitions to determine who is, and is not, a troll. This Article argues that the definition should be conduct-based. Multi-defendant John Doe litigation should be counted as part of copyright trolling whenever these suits are motivated by a desire to turn litigation into an independent revenue stream. Such litigation, when initiated with the aim of turning a profit in the courthouse as opposed to seeking compensation or deterring illegal activity, reflects a kind of systematic opportunism that fits squarely within the concept of litigation trolling. This Article shows that existing status-based definitions of copyright trolls are inapt because they do not account for what is now the most widely practiced from of trolling.\n\nIn addition to these empirical and theoretical contributions, this Article explores the features of copyright doctrine that have facilitated the recent explosion in trolling litigation in the form of litigation against John Does. In particular, it shows how statutory damages and permissive joinder make multi-defendant John Doe (MDJD) litigation possible and why allegations of infringement concerning pornographic films are particularly well-suited to this model.','Main results of the study:\n\n*We are currently witnessing an explosion of copyright trolling in U.S. federal district courts. \n\n*Copyright trolling in the form of MDJD lawsuits has grown rapidly over the last decade and much of the growth has taken place in the last four years. \n\n*The data also shows that MDJD litigation is dominated by claims of infringement relating to pornographic films. \n\n*What little attention has been paid to copyright trolls has largely focused on Righthaven and similar examples — these previous studies have missed the core of the copyright troll phenomenon.\n\n*The opportunism of copyright trolls is primarily directed towards statutory damages. As the Righthaven example shows, statutory damages can make the pursuit of otherwise inconsequential infringements extremely profitable, more profitable than licensing those uses in advance could ever have been. \n\n*As the MDJD cases show, statutory damages stack the deck in favor of the plaintiff such that the underlying liability of the defendant is effectively irrelevant to the settlement calculation.','Policy implications: \n\n*One of the core problems with John Doe litigation in copyright is the lack of any real due process. Once identified, rightly or wrongly, the rational defendant will settle in almost every case because of the overwhelming threat of statutory damages and the difficulty of disproving infringement. \n\n*Statutory damages and the settlements procured in the shadow of statutory damages seem arbitrary and disproportionate to the underlying offense of illegal downloading.\n\n*The technology used to identify suspected infringers raises the specter of surveillance, an increasingly sensitive issue in these post-Snowden times. \n\n*The use of joinder and early discovery to extract account holder information from ISPs while avoiding substantial filing fees looks very much like the exploitation of legal loopholes. \n\n*Even overlooking the sanctionable conduct of some of the more prominent attorneys involved in the pornography cases, the feeling that settlements are procured through something close to extortion is hard to displace.\n\n*Illegal downloading harms copyright owners and reduces their incentives to invest in the production of creative works, but avoiding this harm or being compensated for it has little or nothing to do with the current wave of John Doe litigation that is deluging federal district courts. \n\n*These cases are about monetizing infringement over and above deterrence and compensation. Monetizing infringement is perfectly legal, but unlike the pursuit of deterrence and compensation it is very hard to square with the motivating purpose of copyright law: promoting social progress.\n\n*Reform proposals include: reasonable statutory damages; denying joinder and severing cases; conditional joinder and other safeguards.','http://ssrn.com/abstract=2404950','http://ilr.law.uiowa.edu/',0,0,0,'The author created a database that includes all copyright cases filed in the all federal district courts circuits between January 1, 2001 and March 31, 2014'),('Sag_(2015)','Sag (2015)','http://www.copyrightevidence.org/evidence-wiki/index.php/Sag_(2015)',2015,'IP Litigation in United States District Courts: 1994 to 2014','This article undertakes a broad-based empirical review of Intellectual Property (IP) litigation in United States federal district courts from 1994 to 2014. Unlike the prior literature, this study analyzes federal copyright, patent and trademark litigation trends as a unified whole. It undertakes a systematic analysis of more than 190,000 individual case filings and examines the subject matter, geographical and temporal variation within federal IP litigation over the last two decades. \n\nThis article makes a number of significant contributions to our understanding of IP litigation. It analyzes time trends in copyright, patent and trademark litigation filings at the national level, but it does much more than simply count the number of cases; it explores the meaning behind those numbers and shows how in some cases the observable headline data can be positively misleading. Exploring the changes in the distribution of IP litigation over time and their regional distribution leads to a number of significant insights, these are summarized below. Just as importantly, one of the key contributions of this article is that it frames the context for more fine-grained empirical studies in the future. Many of the results and conclusions herein demonstrate the dangers of basing empirical conclusions on narrow slices of data from selected regions or selected time periods.','* First, the rise of Internet file-sharing has transformed copyright litigation in the United States. More specifically, to the extent that the rate of copyright litigation has increased over the last two decades, that increase appears to be entirely attributable to lawsuits against anonymous Internet file sharers. These lawsuits largely took place in two distinct phases: the first phase largely consisted of lawsuits seeking to discourage illegal downloading; the second phase largely consists lawsuits seeking to monetize online infringement. \n* Second, in relation to patent litigation, the apparent patent litigation explosion between 2010 and 2012 is something of a mirage; however there has been a sustained patent litigation inflation over the last two decades the extent of which has not been fully recognized until now. The reason why this steady inflation was mistaken for a sudden explosion was that the true extent of patent litigation was disguised by permissive joinder.\n* Third, in relation to the geography of IP litigation, it appears that filings in copyright, patent and trademark litigation are generally highly correlated. The major exceptions to that correlation are driven by short term idiosyncratic events in copyright and trademark litigation — these are discussed in detail — and by the dumbfounding willingness of the Eastern district Texas to engage in forum selling to attract patent litigation. The popularity of the Eastern District of Texas as a forum for patent litigation is a well-known phenomenon. However, the data and analysis presented in this study provides a new way of looking at the astonishing ascendancy of this district and the problem of form shopping in patent law more generally.','* This data-driven approach has yielded insights in relation to the Internet filesharing litigation, the true impact of patent trolls on the level of patent litigation, and the extent of forum shopping and forum selling patent litigation.

This enhanced online presence has increased libraries’ exposure to takedown requests from rightsholders and other concerned parties. Using survey questions and interviews, we examined academic libraries’ interaction with both Digital Millennium Copyright Act (“DMCA”) and non-DMCA takedown notices. We found that academic libraries most commonly receive non-DMCA takedown requests that are based on non-copyright issues (such as privacy) or that target materials the library itself has placed online. In general, libraries have well- developed norms and practices in place to manage these types of requests to remove material. We also found, however, that formal DMCA notices directed to libraries have historically been rare, but that this may be changing as open access repositories hosted by libraries grow. In tracing the recent experience of academic libraries that have received DMCA takedown notices targeting material in their open access repositories, we found that libraries have not yet developed norms and practices for addressing these requests. We discuss why this might be, and suggest steps libraries, publishers, and authors can take to best manage copyright conflicts while supporting libraries’ missions to preserve and provide access to knowledge.','Although academic libraries have historically received few formal DMCA takedown requests, recent notice-sending activity, coupled with the growth of open access policies and repositories, suggests that they may receive more DMCA requests as their online offerings grow.

In addition, the growth itself might be curtailed if stakeholders take steps to limit the need to use the DMCA notice and takedown process. Educating authors about author-friendly publishing practices, continuing to push for institutional open access policies, and developing best practices for DMCA notice handling might all help. Deliberate effort from all stakeholders can help ensure that the notice and takedown system strikes a fair balance between academic libraries’ needs to limit liability and fulfill their preservation and access missions and rightsholders’ needs for an effective method for removing infringing content from library platforms.','http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2694731','http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2694731',0,0,0,'The study uses data gathered from 11 surveys and 5 in depth interviews with individuals responsible for actioning takedown notices at academic libraries.'),('Scotchmer_(2011)','Scotchmer (2011)','http://www.copyrightevidence.org/evidence-wiki/index.php/Scotchmer_(2011)_2',2011,'Ideas and Innovations: Which should be subsidized?','The Bayh-Dole Act allows universities to commercialize their research. University laboratories therefore have two sources of funds: direct grants from the government and funds from commercialization. In addition to giving direct subsidies to university laboratories, the government also subsidizes the commercial sector, for example, through tax credits. Subsidies to commerce contribute indirectly to the university\'s research budget, because they increase the profit from commercialization. This paper investigates the optimal mix of direct and indirect subsidies to the university, in a context where the role of university research is to turn up \"ideas\" for commercial investments, and the role of commerce is to turn the ideas into innovations.

The research incorporates a literature review to establish the business model methodology and analyse the current state of research. The research findings show that the creative industries are in a state of business model experimentation. Furthermore, the evidence suggests that the Intellectual Property framework may be secondary to other influences on business models.','The six business model case studies provide a snapshot of the current state of business models in three key creative sectors: games, music and television.\nCollectively, the case studies suggest four main themes: IP, change, differences between sectors and the role of intermediaries. While IP was not often identified as a direct influence on business models, it has an important secondary role. A strong theme was that of change and the fast paced evolution of business models. However, this was tempered by significant differences between the business models of the three sectors. Finally, the role of intermediaries is changing and the evidence suggests that more change may come.','The three creative sectors surveyed in this research imply that the creative industries are far from reaching equilibrium in business models. Researchers and policy makers should expect further, rapid changes in business models as the technology evolves and content adapts. \nThe case studies presented here evidence both disintermediation and intermediation. They do not support a dominating trend of disintermediation which would lead to an overall reduction in intermediaries. Indeed, examples such as the market dominance of iTunes in the music sector and the success of Facebook suggest that the digital era is creating fewer, more powerful intermediaries. As privately owned, for-profit corporations, these intermediaries have significant power as gatekeepers. If the trend continues, it suggests that these platforms may function as natural monopolies. \nAll six of the case studies presented in this report some form of public support.

Given the small sample size, it is possible that that public support is over represented by the SME nature of the case studies and Scottish government’s goals of economic development in these sectors.

It also seeks to review the impact of technological measures on the exercise of these exceptions and the relationship between laws protecting the circumvention of technological measures and the educational exceptions.','* All of the 32 countries (out of 40 countries assigned to this study) with copyright legislations surveyed in this study have some form of exception for the benefit of educational activities.  Most of these are formulated based on Article 10(2) of the Berne Convention. Although the details may differ, the first group of countries has exceptions that mirror the approach in Article 10(2), which is to provide a general exception to sanction the utilization of any work by way of illustration in publications, broadcasts or sound or visual recordings for teaching, to the extent justified by the purpose.  This includes the use of a work for instructional communication.  However, four countries have expressly limited their exceptions to reproductions only, and five have imposed the requirement of face-to-face teaching.  This is likely to create an issue as regards the application of these exceptions for distance and e-learning.\n\n*The second group of countries has implemented the Article 10(2) exception through the enumeration of excepted aspects of educational activities as exceptions.  The attendant conditions for these exceptions can vary in detail, but the excepted activities are chrestomathies, abstracts, educational performances and broadcasts, school textbooks, school rentals and examinations.  In the absence of a general or catch-all exception in their legislation, countries adopting the “enumeration” approach may need to constantly update their copyright exceptions to deal with new uses of works as part of educational instruction.  Given the increasing breadth and variation of educational curriculum, the choice of using a residual educational use exception based on the three-step test seems like a good solution. \n\n* Most countries have exceptions that exempt the personal or private use of works for research or private study purposes.  However, concerns about book piracy have led a first group of eight countries that have broad “personal or private use” exceptions to exclude from the scope of their exceptions the reprography of the whole or a substantial part of books or musical works.  The second group of countries addresses this problem with the concept of “fair use” that creates opportunities for individualistic determinations of permissible usage in each case.  The tension between the potential for “fair use” to serve as a residual exception to permit unanticipated uses of works that add to social utility and to create much harm from its misuse by end users and consumers to collectively make multiple copies of works is  unfortunately a tension that is inherent in the very principle of “fair use” itself (that of a relatively open-ended rule) which can be ameliorated with the recognition of various presumptions of “fair use” where the extent of the work copied is small or determined by the nature of the work e.g. an article in a periodical. \n\n* No less than 16 countries in the countries surveyed in this study have updated their copyright legislation with provisions to deal with technological measures.  However, only a few have provisions to deal with the issue of possible breach of laws protecting the breach of technological measures for educational purposes.  The growing proliferation of electronic books, compilations and databases that are digitally protected may pose challenges for educational institutions seeking to provide access to these legitimately acquired resources for instructional purposes (for instance, to enable multiple access or to make multiple copies of such works for distribution, when the technological measures only permit one copy to be made).','The complexities in this area of legislating for educational exceptions stem largely from the changes that technology is bringing to the field of education. New methods of instruction and new ways to disseminate and access knowledge and information present new opportunities for educators, researchers and students.

In such an environment, both the education and the publishing industry should strive to work more closely together, facilitated by rules and policies that make this possible, because both can and should stand to benefit from the increasing size of the education market made possible by technology.

As China\'s economy grows, its transition from manufacturing-based to knowledge-based production, more comprehensive laws, and more attention to enforcement have led to an increase in the number of IPR infringement cases being brought before the courts or taken up through China\'s administrative procedures. In this paper, the authors analyze the changing role of IPR enforcement in China and examines trends in damages awards in IPR cases in China, using a proprietary database, developed by NERA, of cases filed in China between 2002 and 2008. The authors find that, while there has been a marked increase in IPR infringement cases being brought before Chinese courts and, consequently, in the frequency of damage awards over the past decade, the damages both claimed and awarded tended to be very small compared to those in other jurisdictions and compared to the likely degree of harm caused.','The authors find that, under the administrative systems established in China, penalties and fines\nfor IPR violations generally do not appear to provide adequate deterrence to would-be\ninfringers. Fines are so low that they appear to allow infringers to earn an adequate profit,\neven if caught and fined. Consequently, most studies suggest that fines represent only a\ntiny fraction of the estimated sales revenue lost to IPR holders.\nThe review by the authors also suggests judicial damage awards for IPR violations in China are low\ncompared to the United States and compared to the likely degree of harm caused.\nFurthermore, although the frequency of damage awards in IPR cases in China has\nincreased, the average amount awarded has not increased. However, each year there\nappear to be a few cases which involve significant damages, and these high damage\nawards appear to be occurring more frequently each year.

Unfortunately, SCOURing is also an illegal activity. A better understanding of SCOURing could help to mitigate its practice.

Network-and-software-savvy consumers eventually subvert barriers to SCOURing like encryption. Further, shuttering file-sharing networks merely shifted SCOURing to alternative networks.\n\n* Many consumers believe SCOURing is justified by past pricing abuses of impersonal corporations. Consumers are unwilling to pay more than a trivial amount to download music. Therefore, current pricing schemes for online access are unlikely to reduce SCOURing.\n\n* SCOURing is an entrenched consumer behavior. The most prolific—college-age consumers—grew up sharing files via accessibleP2P networks. As a result, they never or rarely paid for digitised intellectual property; for them, payment would be aberrant. \n\n* The decision to engage in SCOURing is based, at least partly, on beliefs about the behaviours of important others. Consistent with social learning theory, this research suggests peer influence relates positively to SCOURing.\n\n* Motivation (justification, peer influence, and believed risklessness) and ability (tech-savviness) as antecedents to SCOURing suggest why anti-SCOURing legal remedies were impotent and customer alienating. \n\n* If people act in a difficult-to-monitor way believed acceptable to other people, then efforts to coerce anyone to act otherwise is futile.','The authors state that if the findings of the study are correct, \"companies\' efforts to reduce SCOURing by legal action or trying to educate consumers about the victims of SCOURing may be ineffective.\"','http://www.academia.edu/4452748/Motivators_and_enablers_of_SCOURing_A_study_of_online_piracy_in_the_US_and_UK','http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0148296309002033',1,0,1,'This study seeks to explore the behaviour of people engaged in SCOURing (Sharing Copyrighted or Unauthorized Replications). \n\n* The study employs a survey of P2P users in UK and USA as the data collection method. \n\n* The survey sample totalled 574.

Internet piracy is popular and has greatly threatened the companies in these industries. This study tests Hunt-Vitell’s ethical decision model and attempts to understand why and how people share unauthorized music files with others in the peer-to-peer (P2P) network. The norm of anti-piracy, the ideology of free software, the norm of reciprocity, and the ideology of consumer rights are proposed as four deontological norms related to using P2P systems. The model is tested using a scenario survey with four alternatives; the results indicate that the deontological norm of anti-piracy is not a main factor in affecting P2P users’ ethical considerations regarding sharing files with others. This finding suggests that to protect their property rights, record companies should try to realize the consumer benefits brought via new digital and network technology, instead of simply declaring their intellectual property and resisting the innovations resulting from new technologies.','The main results reported in this study:\n\n*This study tested the Hunt–Vitell model to explore the impacts of multiple norms on users’ ethical decisions about variant ways of using the P2P network to share copyrighted music files.\n\n*The results show that deontological evaluations are influenced by the belief in the ideology of consumer rights in all alternatives, and its impacts are larger than most of the other antecedents. Consumer rights may be the major and general cause for sharing music files in the P2P network.\n\n*The norm of reciprocity and the ideology of freeware can also motive people to use a free P2P system to sharing music files, but their using free P2P systems is discouraged by their belief in the norm of anti-piracy.\n\n*There are several reasons for the weak impact of the belief in the norm of anti-piracy. First, paying the P2P provider may transfer guilt and the problem of piracy to the P2P system provider. People may believe they are doing a good thing for both musicians and consumers by distributing good music, instead of hurting copyright holders. The large numbers on a P2P network and the anonymity of a computer-mediated environment may also create ethical ambiguity and lead to deindividuation. This leads to the negative effects of decreasing self- awareness and stimulating anti-normative behavior.\n\n*The Hunt–Vitell model suggests that when behavior and intentions are inconsistent with ethical judgments, one of the consequences will be guilt (Hunt and Vitell, 1986). Unethical behavior, however, like other behaviors, is learned in social interaction. People learn the techniques of neutralization, which is a set of justifications or rationalizations that can insulate people from self-blame when they engage in norm-violating behaviors.','Policy implications reported in the study:\n\n*Since consumers can easily rationalize their behavior while copying files from the Internet, simply proclaiming intellectual property rights and the norm of anti-piracy may be ineffective for reducing unauthorized copying.\n\n*The popularity of P2P systems that charge may suggest that people would like to pay small fees to reduce their guilt or legal considerations about copying files, even when there is free music on the Internet. The success of iTunes firmly supports this idea.\n\n*Companies should try to apply and realize the advantages of new technologies to increase consumers’ benefits, instead of resisting change, simply declaring their rights, and imposing the guilt of piracy on consumers.

We suggest that network effects are a function of network size (i.e., installed customer base) and network strength (i.e., the marginal impact of a unit increase in network size on demand). We empirically study these network effects in the 16-bit home video game industry in which the dominant competitors were Nintendo and Sega. In the spirit of the new empirical IO framework, we estimate a structural econometric model assuming the data are equilibrium outcomes of the best fitting non-cooperative game in price and advertising. After controlling for other effects, we find strong evidence that network effects are asymmetric between the competitors in the home video game industry. Specifically, we find that the firm with a smaller customer network (Nintendo) has higher network strength than the firm with the larger customer base (Sega). Thus, our results provide a possible explanation for this situation in which the firm with a smaller customer network (Nintendo) was able to overtake the sales of a firm with a larger network size (Sega).','Consistent with most theoretical models’ assumption that the direct effect of a customer network on demand is symmetric across competitors (e.g., Katz and Shapiro 1985; 1985; 1992; Farrell and Saloner 1985; 1986), This paper finds that:\n\n* The network size coefficients of Nintendo and Sega are significant but not statistically different. \n\n* In agreement with the hedonic price models for computer spreadsheet software (e.g., Gandal 1994; 1995; Brynjolfson and Kemerer 1996), Price effectiveness of Nintendo and Sega is a function of network size. \n\n* Each firm’s advertising effectiveness is influenced by its relative network size. \n\n* empirical results also show that Nintendo and Sega have asymmetric network effects since the interactive network strength values through price and advertising are statistically different for the two firms. \n\n* These asymmetric network strength values may help explain why Nintendo was able to pass Sega in monthly sales of 16-bit home video game systems despite Sega’s larger installed base.',NULL,'http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=296534','http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/smj.296/abstract',0,0,0,'The data available for estimation purposes include monthly time-series information between January 1993 and August 1995 for Nintendo and Sega 16-bit hardware sales (units), hardware price (dollars), advertising expenditures (millions of dollars), and installed customer base size (units) for the 16-bit systems (and Nintendo’s 8-bit system).

Under a reward system, innovators are paid for innovations directly by the government (possibly on the basis of sales), and innovations pass immediately into the public domain. Thus, reward systems engender incentives to innovate without creating the monopoly power of intellectual property rights. But a principal difficulty with rewards is the information required for their determination. We conclude in our model that intellectual property rights do not possess a fundamental social advantage over reward systems and that an optional reward system—under which innovators choose between rewards and intellectual property rights—is superior to intellectual\nproperty rights.','In a regime with rewards, drugs would be far cheaper and more widely used, all computer software would be free, and electronically recorded materials would be inexpensive, arguably engendering significant increases in consumer welfare. Moreover, there would also be potential gains from enhanced incentives to innovate, as profits from patent and copyright may fall considerably short of consumer surplus. For example, Kremer suggests that studies of the social versus the private returns from research indicate that private profits from research might well be only one-third of the social returns. Because optimal rewards would reflect the\nsocial returns, rewards would increase overall incentives to invest.','Reward systems, or optional reward systems, and especially those based on sales-related information, appear on reflection to hold promise as alternatives to our system of intellectual property rights, because there is no necessity to marry the incentive to innovate to conferral of monopoly power in innovations. As such, serious study of the possibility of reward systems, with a view toward their implementation at least on an experimental, partial basis, is worth contemplating.','http://www.nber.org/papers/w6956.pdf','http://www.nber.org/papers/w6956.pdf',0,0,0,'This study proposes an economic model comparing a reward system with Intellectual Property Rights.

The study found that economic utility, collection utility, and social utility all motivate digital music piracy. A key finding was that social utility was the most important motivation for illegal downloading. Looking at music piracy as a social phenomenon may be a key to improving the effectiveness of antipiracy strategies.','Main results reported in this study: \n\n*Economic, collection, and social utilities all motivate digital music piracy. \n\n*The importance of social utility was an important new finding: it may support music piracy as an aspect of social network theory (Kadushin, 2004), which underscores the importance of social connections and relationships in regard to individual actions. \n\n*Although our previous qualitative results led us to believe that social utility was an important motivator, our quantitative results showed that it contributed more to the level of gratification than economic utility. \n\n*Social utility was the most important motivation for illegal downloading, collection utility was the second most important motivation, followed by economic utility, which is surprising.\n\n*Specific factors that reinforced the motivations to download include previously documented anti-musician/anti-music industry feelings and feelings of optimistic bias. \n\n*The most significant findings were related to the influence of social aspects. Higher levels of social acceptance led to stronger motivations to illegally download.\n\n*A previously researched result was reinforced: when moral conscience was low, desire to illegally download is high (Gopal et al., 2004). Rather than being an absolute measure of moral conscience (i.e., right vs. wrong), if we look at this through the social lens, we can see it more as a measure of what is deemed socially acceptable or unacceptable. \n\n*In personal and group interviews, the legal cost for downloading using on-campus servers was seen as extremely high. Most respondents had a friend, or had heard of someone, who had been caught and/or fined. Off campus, in the “real world,” however, respondents indicated that their fear of being caught was infinitesimally small. \n\n*With such a low perceived possibility of being caught, it is reasonable to theorize that the optimistic bias of college kids regarding legal costs grew to such an extent that legal costs no longer had the potential to act as a brake on illegal behavior.','Policy Implications reported in the study:\n\n*The music industry should not only be developing strategies to fight individual downloaders, as a focus on individual lawsuits does. Rather, they should perceive the problem as fundamentally group oriented, or social. This indicates that grass roots efforts within colleges that focus on times when students are assembled either physically or in social networks could prove effective. \n\n*In terms of broader communication, messages with the objective of overturning peer group social acceptance by showing the cost of the behavior on the peer group, its image, or society at large might be more effective than focus on individual risks. \n\n*In addition to social strategies, any program, legal approach, or advertising campaign aiming to increase the perception of personal risk needs to reframe the perception of risk substantially. Aside from using on-campus servers, the perception of personal risk to college students is, today, very small. \n\n*A swift and drastic shift in perception would be important not just on an individual basis but because it could create a social tipping point among college peers. A key to combining personal and social costs might be to focus on things related to music piracy that could cause extreme personal embarrassment within the insular social peer networks of college campuses.','http://facultynh.syr.edu/bjsheeha/Research%20Projects/music%20download%20research/AJC/AJC%20Article%20Proof.pdf','http://www-tandfonline-com.ezproxy.lib.gla.ac.uk/doi/full/10.1080/15456870.2010.521471#abstract',0,0,0,'The convenience samples of the study included 204 college students who voluntarily participated in an anonymous survey in February 2009.

Based on our survey, twenty-four cents. That\'s how much less our respondents were willing to pay for a music track when a perfect digital copy was replaced by an analog hole copy. Although our results need to be replicated on a larger scale, they suggest many conclusions that have never before been proved: people are willing to pay for less-than-perfect analog hole copies of songs; people will pay much more than half the price of a typically-priced digital music file for its degraded alternative; and even self-avowed \"pirates\" show a willingness to pay for digital music, albeit at prices well below today\'s market standard of ninety-nine cents a song.','* The study shows that consumers are willing to price differentiate on quality and that would-be pirates are willing to pay for content, albeit at a significantly reduced price. These results all point to lost opportunities for the music industry.\n\n* Price discrimination based on quality can increase sales, profits and seller surplus. The community of pirates may be “brought back into the fold” if the 80% who are willing to pay can find a market.\n\n* Furthermore, although analog hole exploits tend to lead to detectably degraded copies, many ordinary consumers will not notice the difference. This also supports industry fears that analog hole copies may serve as a market substitute for DRM-protected digital copies.\n\n* The survey sample sizes used in this study were not large enough to reach external validity for applying these results to the general population. Looking forward, a next step would be to execute a similar survey to the one administered for this paper but on a much larger scale.','Alternative pricing models might be able to capture individuals who are willing to pay from 20 to 40 % of an illegal download.','http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=969998','http://www.jthtl.org/content/articles/V5I3/JTHTLv5i3_SickerOhmGunaji.PDF',0,0,0,'A survey itself conducted using Zoomerang, an Internet survey application.The survey collected responses from 70 participants.

Digital rights management systems aim to prevent unauthorized copying and to reduce the overall rate of piracy. Therefore, the recent move toward offering DRM-free music by some major online music sellers appears paradoxical. In this article, the authors propose a model that conceptualizes and estimates the concept of hardcore piracy in an attempt to resolve this apparent paradox. Based on two large empirical studies and a validation exercise with a large sample of more 2000 college students, the model results indicate that the music industry can benefit from removing DRM because such a strategy has the potential to convert some pirates into paying consumers. In addition, a DRM-free environment enhances both consumer and producer welfare by increasing the demand for legitimate products as well as consumers’ willingness to pay for these products. The authors find that producers could benefit by lowering prices from currently observed levels. The article concludes with a discussion of the practical implications of the findings for managers within the music industry.','* Two related studies consider piracy from a demand perspective. A new model introduces the concept of “hardcore pirates”, offering a new and unique method for conceptualizing and measuring piracy in terms of willingness to pay (WTP).\n\n* The results indicate that Digital Rights Management (DRM) is not a control mechanism that is independent of consumer preferences but rather an important product attribute that consumers include in their evaluation of online music products. \n\n* The removal of DRM increases the utility of legally purchased music – for example, it can be played on different devices. This might increase consumers’ WTP for legally sold digital music.\n\n* Both studies therefore conclude that reducing DRM controls might  increase overall revenues for digital music, while converting some hardcore pirates into paying consumers.\n\n* Reductions in prices for music that is popular among college students might also be beneficial for both consumers and producers, though increased legal sales digital music.\n\n* Although the study was limited to college students, external evidence indicates that a significant proportion of software pirates are in that population.','* “These results provide important ‘consumer-based’ rationale for the emerging trend toward a DRM-free environment for music.”\n\n* “In addition, they provide support for the notion that under certain circumstances, consumers may prefer to pay for a product, even if they can obtain it for free.”\n\n* “A key implications of our findings is that regardless of the specific effects, consumers include the control mechanisms that DRM imposes on digital music not only in their valuation decisions but also in their  decisions to become ‘nonpaying’ consumers.”\n\n* Consequently, the “managerial logic” is that “pursuing a pure DRM-free or significantly relaxed DRM strategy may be optimal”.\n\n* It would be worthwhile researching whether removing DRM and reducing prices would be an optimal strategy for the producers of all digital goods.',NULL,'http://journals.ama.org/doi/abs/10.1509/jmkg.74.2.40',0,0,0,'Two successive studies used data from > 2000 undergraduate students of diverse disciplines at a “major public university”. \n\nStudy 1, in Spring 2007, used a final clean survey sample of 816 respondents - 58% male, average age 19.7 years, 91% owned a portable music player, 44% attended concerts regularly, 27% visited music stores regularly.\n \nStudy 2 survey was administered to 1,312 students during Autumn 2008.'),('Sinha_and_Mandel_(2008)','Sinha and Mandel (2008)','http://www.copyrightevidence.org/evidence-wiki/index.php/Sinha_and_Mandel_(2008)',2008,'Preventing digital music piracy: The carrot or the stick?','The goal of this article is to ascertain the factors that govern consumers’ willingness to pirate a digital product, such as a digital music track. The authors assess the tendency to pirate with both indirect measures (e.g., willingness to pay for the legal alternative) and direct measures (e.g., piracy preference). Whether measured indirectly or directly, the tendency to pirate depends, to different extents, on three key factors: positive incentives (e.g., improved functionality of the legal Web site), negative incentives (e.g., perceived risk of piracy), and consumer characteristics. Based on three studies, the results suggest that negative incentives are a strong deterrent for certain consumers but can actually increase piracy tendencies for others. Conversely, positive incentives, such as improved functionality, can significantly reduce the tendency to pirate among all the consumer segments studied.

Our analysis, based on results from thousands of adults around the globe, shows that not only have remixes, mashups and other forms of \"configurable culture\" become mainstream phenomena, but also that the attitudes surrounding their cultural legitimacy are shifting. While copyright industries still promote a binary theft/permission framework, many people acknowledge the validity of some appropriation, and are actively negotiating the law’s limitations. Yet, those most engaged in challenging dominant copyright narratives and exploring these emergent forms are those who hold the reins of cultural power: the young, educated and wealthy.','Main results of study:\n\n*Configurable cultural practices, which employ digital networked technologies and collapse the traditional distinction between production and consumption, have grown in awareness, usage and engagement among Americans in recent years. \n\n*Configurable culture has global reach and its impact is greater outside of the US than within it.\n\n*The authors found that nationality, age, gender and income tend to vary with degrees of expertise, awareness, usage, engagement and opinion regarding these cultural practices.\n\n*Young people are far more likely than their elders to concede that appropriation-based work such as mashups and remixes are always or sometimes “original” and therefore culturally valuable or valid. \n\n*Users of Creative Commons licenses tend to skew younger, wealthier, better educated, and more male than the overall population, problematizing the premise that such licenses may serve to democratize cultural power.','Policy Implications:\n\n*Findings on configurability, gender and income raise some concerns regarding self-efficacy and social equality. \n\n*While men and women appear to know about configurable culture in equal numbers, the enduring gap in engagement, especially when it comes to technology-centric media such as software and games, suggests that even if they have an equivalent level of access to digital technology, women tend to have a lower level of expertise and/or perceived self-efficacy in relation to such technology. \n\n*Similarly, the fact that income tends to vary with usage and engagement, but not awareness, suggests that full participation in digital culture still requires a degree of social power conferred by wealth.

Previous research indicates that neutralization, a form of rationalization, can help explain software piracy intentions. However, a knowledge gap exists in our understanding of which neutralization techniques most influence software piracy intention. To address this gap, we developed a model that explains the effects of neutralization techniques on software piracy intention. We included different types of deterrents (formal sanctions, shame, and moral belief) in our model because individuals may use neutralization techniques to mitigate feelings of guilt and shame, which, subsequently, reduce the deterrent effect. Our empirical results (for 183 people surveyed) showed that appeal to higher loyalties and condemn the condemners strongly predict software piracy intentions. In addition, informal deterrents such as shame and moral beliefs are strong predictors. These findings suggest that anti-piracy efforts should involve educational intervention aimed at addressing these two neutralization techniques rather than relying on formal sanctions.','The main results reported in the study: \n\n*The neutralization technique \'Appeal to Higher Loyalties\' significantly increased the intention to pirate software. \n\n*The neutralization technique \'Condemn the Condemners\' significantly increased intention to pirate software; this is also a new predictor of software piracy. \n\n*The other components of neutralisation (Denial of Injury, Metaphor of the Ledger, Defense of Necessity, Denial of Responsibility or Denial of the Victim) did not have a significant effect on individuals’ intentions to pirate software. \n\n*The effect of \'Moral Beliefs\' on intention to commit software piracy was significant. \n\n*\'Formal Sanctions\' had no deterring effect on software piracy intention. This finding is consistent with studies on corporate crime, it differs from that of Higgins et al (2005).\n\n*Although these findings suggest that \'Formal Sanctions\' may not be a strong predictor of intent to pirate software, there may be other forms of sanctions that can deter software piracy. For example, the effect of \'Shame\' on intention to commit piracy was significant.','Policy implications reported in the study: \n\n*Our results suggest that all sections of society should use shame as a deterrent to software piracy while attempting to convince people that software piracy is morally wrong.\n\n*In order to address the neutralization technique of \'condemn the condemners\' and \'appeal to higher loyalties,\' educators and anti-piracy organizations must make a convincing case that arguments such as ‘‘it is acceptable to copy for a friend or someone who does not have money’’ are not tenable or ‘‘software agreements are unfair’’. \n\n*The results that suggest certainty and severity of shame have a significant deterrent effect on software piracy opens up an avenue for campaigns and education strategies that stress the likelihood and severity of shame. \n\nSoftware development companies, educators, and anti-piracy organizations need to make a justified and convincing case that software piracy is not morally acceptable.

Our work addresses both the relative neglect of non-patent intellectual property rights and the disproportionate reliance on the IP-as-substitutes view in prior research.','Main results:\n\n*The authors propose a broader view of the interactions between different types of IP, where both substitution and complementarity is possible. They abstract away from individual inventions to look at the set of multiple inventions contained in a product or a firm.\n\n*When the analysis is focused on a set of inventions, opportunities for IP complementarity arise because firms may extract value by leveraging one type of IP for some inventions while at the same time leveraging another type of IP for other related inventions. Such complementarity may occur due to either production-cost or market-driven interactions, which increase the value of using different types of IP together.\n\n*The research uncovers robust evidence that the use of two types of intellectual property – copyright and trademark – is strongly correlated in software firms. \n\n*The interview evidence also supports the idea that these forms of intellectual property may be leveraged in a complementary fashion. From a managerial perspective, this finding suggests that firms may benefit by paying attention to the complementary configuration of different types of IP to protect their bundles of intellectual assets, rather than focusing on each one in isolation. \n\n*Both the interview evidence and empirical results corroborate the use of common indivisible inputs in IP strategies, expressly managerial attention and organizational resources, as an important explanation for our finding of IP complementarity.','Policy implications:\n\n*Future research should explore the conditions under which specific types of IP are profitably used as substitutes, or as complements. Another potential direction for research would be to abstract away from the single invention unit of analysis along the temporal dimension, and study the interactions between different types of IP for a related set of inventions over time. \n\n*The results do not specifically explain why some firms paid greater attention to IP strategy and developed superior organizational IP resources over certain time frames. Future research can help us understand when firms react to changes in their intellectual property environments with responsive strategies, and when they do not.','http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=887484',NULL,0,0,0,'Primary Data: The authors contacted 25 executives identified as IP legal counsel or IP managers in 19 of the top 100 U.S. packaged software firms by revenue (2001). 6 individuals (38%) at 5 firms agreed to be interviewed.

On the other side of the Atlantic, however, many European countries give creators, at least in their copyright laws, much stronger rights to attribution. At first blush it may seem that the U.S. has gotten it wrong, and the Europeans have made a better policy choice in providing to creators a right that they value. But for reasons we will explain in this Article, matters are much more complicated.\nThis Article reports a series of experiments that are the first to attempt to measure quantitatively the value of attribution to creators. In previous research, we have shown that creators of IP are subject to a “creativity effect” that results in their assigning substantially higher value to their works than neoclassical economic theory predicts. The first two experiments reported in this Article suggest a way that the creativity effect may be reduced: creators are willing to sacrifice significant economic payments in favor of receiving attribution for their work. The value to creators of attribution raises the question whether U.S. IP law should be restructured to provide attribution as a creator’s default right.\nThe third and most important experiment reported here casts doubt on the value of giving creators such a default right, because creators value attribution differently depending on whether the legal rule gives it to them as an initial entitlement or not. When creators are given a right to attribution as a default, they value credit four times higher than when attribution is not the default option. Our findings make clear that creators value attribution, and that the prospect of obtaining it can lead to a more efficient level of transacting. At the same time, paradoxically, our findings suggest that we should exercise caution before we restructure U.S. law, which provides no right to attribution for the vast majority of creators. Indeed, it is possible, under conditions that we will describe, that providing creators with a default right to attribution will result in less efficient transacting.\nFinally, our findings have implications for property theory which are broader than IP law or attribution rights. Our third experiment suggests that a party who enjoys a default legal right as part of her initial complement of rights will tend to treat that legal right in a fashion similar to any other form of initial entitlement, and overvalue it relative to what neoclassical theory would predict. This suggests a principle regarding how to efficiently structure default rules in any setting. All other factors being equal, an efficiently structured default rule will locate the initial legal entitlement in the party who is either less likely to overvalue the entitlement, or, if overvaluation seems inevitable regardless of where the initial entitlement is placed, is likely to overvalue it less.','Main results:\n\n*The photographers behaved similarly to the poets and painters in the authors\' previous experiments, and set their WTA significantly higher than their expected mean value.\n\n*For amateur photographers, the prospect of publication with attribution results in a significantly lower \'Willingness To Accept\' (WTA) compared to the WTA reported by subjects in the Contest and Publication conditions pooled together. This finding suggests that the prospect of publication with attribution has a modest but nonetheless statistically significant effect of reducing WTA compared to a situation where subjects are not offered the prospect of publication with attribution.\n\n*Given the strong preference for attribution, publication without attribution may be viewed negatively, which would account for the higher average WTA in the Publication condition versus the Contest condition (although this was not significant at the 0.05 confidence level).\n\n*The data also suggest that professional and advanced amateur photographers place a somewhat greater value on the prospect of publication with attribution compared with their amateur counterparts. The professional subjects’ WTA in the Attribution condition was lower by a significant amount compared to the Contest subjects’ WTA. This is fairly strong evidence that creators attach some substantial value to credited publication of their work.\n\n*The creators’ behavior indicates that they valued attribution at $415.07. The professional and advanced amateur photographers value attribution far more than the casual snapshooters.\n\n*In the third experiment, subjects altered the amount of money they were willing to accept in ways that were consistent with placing a significant economic value on attribution.\n\n*This study suggests that a waivable default attribution rule could have a significant – and negative – effect on the efficiency of markets to license IP.\n\n*When the subjects were initially endowed with a right to attribution, they valued it substantially more than they did when they were not so endowed and had to purchase it. In the study, subjects valued attribution four times higher under the Default Attribution condition than when the default was no attribution.','Policy implications:\n\n*The authors\' experiments provide the first quantitative measure of the monetary value that creators attach to attribution and publication opportunities. The experiments provide new data that can help shape the debate about the desirability of attribution rights in the U.S. and abroad.\n\n*These experiments indicate that, all else being equal, altering U.S. copyright law to provide creators with default attribution rights can result in higher transaction costs and less efficient transacting.\n\n*U.S. copyright law, which provides creators of a wide variety of artistic and literary works with broad rights to control reproduction, distribution, modification, and the public performance and display of their works, does not provide most creators with any general right to attribution. This research provides quantitative empirical evidence for the notion that creators significantly value attribution.\n\n*It does not necessarily follow that the U.S. should include a right to attribution in the law simply because creators value it. From a utilitarian perspective, attribution, just like any other aspect of IP rights, should be assigned in such a way that it is likely to reduce transaction costs and generate efficient bargains. \n\n*In light of the findings of the third experiment, the research seems to undermine utilitarian arguments for creating a waivable attribution right.','http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2011403','http://scholarship.kentlaw.iit.edu/fac_schol/733/',0,0,0,'The authors performed three separate experiments. \n\nExperiment 1: This experiment tested the value that creators attach to attribution and publication. 200 “lay” creative subjects, who indicated an interest in photography, were recruited as participants using Amazon Mechanical Turk (mTurk).

The wording of the legislation is considered in detail with the aid of case law to provide context where necessary, particularly with reference to fair dealing provisions. Developments within the Digital Single Market of the European Union also have a significant impact on national copyright law, and it is imperative that information professionals remain informed about upcoming copyright initiatives as well as making sense of the new statutory instruments.','* As to the text and data analysis exception, research libraries in particular acknowledge that their researchers benefit from performing computational analysis on large amounts of information. Some research librarians have reported receiving emails from publishers of electronic subscription databases concerned about mass access to articles triggered by the performance of text and data analysis.\n\n* As to the copy for disabled people exception, expanding s.31A-F to account for persons with learning disabilities and other non-visual types of impairment has been greatly welcomed by the library sector.\n\n* As to s.35 of the Copyright, Designs, Patents Act 1988 (CDPA), following the change in the law, the ERA withdrew its basic licence which meant that educational establishments had little option but to take the ERA+ licence. This has predominantly affected the Higher Education (HE) sector the most as the cost of the licence has risen significantly. \n\n* As to s.36 CDPA, most information professionals working in educational establishments are anxious not to break the law, and given the risk-averse nature of the sector, are often reluctant to test the waters with any seemingly risky activities.\n\n* As to s.40B CDPA, the lack of the requirement of adequate compensation in the UK would likely be an issue should a British case similar to Technische Universitaet Darmstadt v Eugen Ulmer KG be referred to the CJEU.\n\n* The extension of the preservation exception has greatly relieved the burden on information professionals who handle large amounts of fragile material, and has eased their frustration at not being able to make further copies of redundant formats before it is no longer technically possible to do so.\n\n* The biggest impact of the changes to document supply legislation relates to the user declaration form. Once enshrined in the CDPA as the statutory form which required a physical signature from end users, the changes to the legislation now allow for a much more flexible approach with regards to the user declaration, and may encompass electronic signatures, online forms and email declarations.\n\n* The quotation of whole photographs and other images is possible and permitted by the exception; however, it would be wise to exercise caution when reproducing whole images for quotation purposes as the economic value of the image must not be significantly undermined.\n\n* Universities in particular have been making full use of the exception under s.32 CDPA by including extracts of works in PowerPoint slides, using figures to illustrate specific teaching points and reproducing excerpts of music for instruction.','* It is therefore advisable for information professionals to proactively engage with their user communities to ensure that they are aware of text and data analysis and can respond to publisher concerns appropriately.\n\n* As to s.40B CDPA, information professionals may wish to disable drives for portable devices and access to the Internet from the dedicated terminal to reduce the risk of infringing copyright.',NULL,'http://journals.cambridge.org/action/displayAbstract?fromPage=online&aid=10065045',0,0,0,'The author analysis the sections of the Copyright, Design, and Patents Act 1988 constituting the new framework for copyright exceptions in the UK'),('Steinmetz_and_Tunnell_(2013)','Steinmetz and Tunnell (2013)','http://www.copyrightevidence.org/evidence-wiki/index.php/Steinmetz_and_Tunnell_(2013)',2013,'Under the Pixelated Jolly Roger: A Study of On-Line Pirates','Digital piracy—a type of copyright infringement—is a global phenomenon that allegedly contains grave economic consequences for intellectual property industries.

Project documentation was also made available, and this material takes two forms: policy documents which were circulated and updated as the project took place; and an internal report produced towards the end of the project, which includes a variety of statistics and more general lessons learned. \n\nThe report finds that while the initial risk management strategy adopted by the Wellcome has been successful, there is still very little evidence available about the success of rights clearance and risk management in the UK archive sector, and that further empirical investigation is required.','Based on the results of the rights clearance exercise, and the material now available on the Wellcome Library website, Codebreakers has been a significant success for both the Wellcome Library and the 3rd party archives involved.

They managed these risks in three ways.\nFirst: the publication of in-copyright material online was made possible using a risk management strategy which involves a set of risk criteria for identifying medium and high-risk rightsholders in the collections, and a diligent search standard for locating and contacting rightsholders.\nSecond: they managed the publication of potentially sensitive material online using their Access to Archives policy, which provides guidance that can be followed for all physical, digitised and born-digital material held across the Wellcome Library, to take into account both searchroom\nand online access to sensitive, personal data.\nThird: in addition to this, they have an established takedown policy which predates Codebreakers, and applies to all material available on their website. The most significant indicators of success for the archives clearance process include the number of permissions to publish granted: of the 77% of rightsholders contacted who responded, 98% said yes.

It used a random selection as possible of 140 books published between 1870 and 2010 – 10 per decade – from the collection of the British Library. The study sought to determine whether\npermission could be received to digitise them and to achieve the following goals: a. Identify the copyright status of the material and the proportion of ‘orphan works’ (those in-copyright\nworks whose owners cannot be identified or located). ii. Measure and quantify the level of diligent search currently required to undertake mass digitisation of material from the last 140 years. iii. Understand the relationship between commercial activity of library collection items and wider availability. iv. Compare the outputs of a ‘manual’ diligent search for rights holders against the ‘automated’ ARROW system.','1 29% of the books were out of copyright, 57% were identified as in copyright and the remaining\n14% had an unknown copyright status (presumed to be in copyright for the purposes of digitisation).\n\n2 Of the total number of potentially in-copyright works 43% were orphan works, equating to 31% of the total sample. They ranged in date from the 1870s to the 1990s.\n\n3 The type of publisher had a large impact on whether works were orphaned with self-published works accounting for 51% of all orphan works in the study.\n\n4 Only 21% of the books in the total sample were still in print, almost half of which were in-copyright titles published between 1990 and 2010. Most of the rest were public domain material from the decades around the turn of the 19th and 20th centuries, a considerable proportion of which are available as print on demand rather than warehoused print runs.\n\n5 The decade which featured the highest proportion of definitely in-copyright orphan works was the 1980s (50%) which demonstrated that although age may be a factor in whether a work becomes orphaned, even material from the recent past is clearly affected by this issue.\n\n6 56.5% of books in the sample were published by non-mainstream publishers such as professional\nassociations, institutions and political organisations.\n\n7 Permission to digitise was sought for 73% of the books in the sample. Of these:\n* rightsholders gave permission for just 17% of the books to be digitised;\n* permission was not granted for 26% of the titles;\n* for 26% of the titles no response was received;\n* rightsholder contact details for the remaining 31% of the titles could not be located.\n\n8 On average it took 4 hours per book to undertake a “diligent search”. This involved clarifying the copyright status of the work and then identifying rightsholders and requesting permissions.\n\n9 In contrast the use of the ARROW system took less than 5 minutes per title to upload the catalogue records and check the results.\n\n10 During the study the diligent search and the ARROW system identified the same copyright status for 51% of titles. System improvements made soon after the study closure subsequently brought this figure to 69%.

The material in these collections has, in a great many cases, been put on shelves and essentially forgotten about. To make it widely available in digital form is to increase understanding of our history, our traditions and the world within which we live. To limit this just to items that are clearly in the public domain through the lack of efficient rights clearance mechanisms would mean omitting the 20th century from this understanding. \n\n* The potential that a single automated diligent search (the Arrow system) is all that is needed to clear rights – a search for which a user need invest only minimal time in uploading records and reviewing responses – makes mass clearance of rights an achievable goal.\n\n* ARROW also has the potential to play a significant role in any legislative solution to orphan works, acting as a single registry through which cultural institutions could identify works they have digitised and rightsholders could claim any works to which they own the rights.','https://www.arrow-net.eu/sites/default/files/Seeking%20New%20Landscapes.pdf','https://www.arrow-net.eu/sites/default/files/Seeking%20New%20Landscapes.pdf',0,0,0,'The subject of the study was a computer-generated random sample of catalogue records of books and other\nmonographs held by the British Library which had been published in each of the 14 decades from 1870 to 2010.

But empirical evidence gives much reason to doubt these assumptions; people exhibit bounded rationality, bounded self-interest, and bounded willpower. This article offers a broad vision of how law and economics analysis may be improved by increased attention to insights about actual human behavior. It considers specific topics in the economic analysis of law and proposes new models and approaches for addressing these topics. The analysis of the article is organized into three categories: positive, prescriptive, and normative. Positive analysis of law concerns how agents behave in response to legal rules and how legal rules are shaped. Prescriptive analysis concerns what rules should be adopted to advance specified ends. Normative analysis attempts to assess more broadly the ends of the legal system: Should the system always respect people\'s choices? By drawing attention to cognitive and motivational problems of both citizens and government, behavioral law and economics offers answers distinct from those offered by the standard analysis.','* Traditional law and economics is largely based on the standard assumptions of neoclassical economics. These assumptions are sometimes useful but often false. People display bounded rationality: they suffer from certain biases, such as overoptimism and self-serving conceptions of fairness; they follow heuristics, such as availability, that lead to mistakes; and they behave in accordance with prospect theory rather than expected utility theory. People also have bounded willpower; they can be tempted and are sometimes myopic. They take steps to overcome this limitations. Finally, people are boundedly self-interested.\n\n* Even in a world without transactions costs and wealth effects, the assignment of property rights alters the allocation of resources, and that this may be particularly true for certain forms of property-rights assignment (such as court orders). These features of the world matter greatly for making predictions and formulating policy\n\n* People react differently to potential outcomes depending on whether they are perceived as foregone gains or out-of-pocket costs (losses), and that they are likely to think, mistakenly, that salient events are more common than equally prevalent but more subtle ones. These points bear on the supply of and the demand for law, and on the behavior of agents in their interactions with the legal system\n\n* Many laws which are seemingly inefficient and do not benefit powerful interest groups may be explained on grounds of judgments about right and wrong.\n\n* Cognitive difficulties and motivational distortions undermine or alter conventional economic prescriptions about the jury\'s role, most notably in the context of assessing negligence and making other factual determinations\n\n* A behavioural approach raises serious doubts about the reflexive antipaternalism of some of economic analysis of law. On the other hand, it raises equivalent questions about whether even well-motivated public officials will be able to offer appropriate responses to private mistakes and confusion.','* The authors hope that in thirty years there will be no such thing as behavioral economics.

The approximately one thousand respondents between fifteen and twenty-five years-of-age showed, among other things, that although actual file-sharing behaviour had to some extent decreased in frequency, social norms remained unaffected by the law.','The main results reported by the study:\n\n*The results indicate that the implementation of enforcement strategies in Sweden has not triggered any sudden changes in the strength of social norms relating to illegal file sharing\n\n*However, the fact that IPRED actually changed people’s behaviour with regard to compliance contradicts that conclusion. Behavioural change sometimes leads to changes in the social norm structures, even when the former has occurred as a result of enforcement strategies.\n\n*The survey results show that one possible cause why people in common ignore copyright online is the lack of social norms that reinforce the legal framework. Generally, people observe informal social control, and when the law, as in this instance, lacks a social equivalent, there are only weak incentives for them to comply with it. \n\n*If implementation of IPRED in Swedish legislation on April 1 2009 was able to influence social norms, the effect was marginal; thus the pedagogical effect of the law does not come into play.\n\n*Considerably more respondents stated that they ￼never file-share in Study 2 than is the case in Study 1. This means that the implementation of IPRED actually has had an effect on file sharing as such, but this is a purely deterrent effect rather than a change of social norms. \n\nThe study reports the following limitations:\n\n*Limitations inherent in the quantitative approach suggest a need for future qualitative research that complements the understanding of file sharing and legal compliance from a situated-cognitive perspective. This could include the impact of other factors such as the media’s role in communicating legal revisions, or a more language and conceptual metaphor-based approach to copyright formulations and functions in comparison with a digitalized society \n\n*A follow up-study ￼of the same survey as in this study might prove useful in confirming, refuting or nuancing the long-time effects of IPRED’s implementation that are suggested here.','Policy implications of the study include: \n\n*Given the gap shown to exist between copyright law and social norms, there are likely negative and unconsidered consequences of the enforcement strategies. \n\n*Legal enforcement of a copyright regulation that does not correspond with social norms risks working as a stimulus to counter-measures. Given the generativity of the technologies of online communication in networks, these counter-measures may imply an increased diffusion of techniques of online anonymization. \n\n*This means that the legal enforcement of copyright not only risks undermining public confidence in the legal system in general, but also facilitates the diffusion of technological knowledge that will undermine legal enforcement in general when it comes to computer-mediated crime.','https://lup.lub.lu.se/search/publication/2520386','http://nms.sagepub.com.ezproxy.lib.gla.ac.uk/content/14/7/1147.full',0,0,0,'Two surveys were conducted: the first in January and February 2009, with 1047 internet users aged between fifteen and twenty-five years, and the second in October 2009 with a different set of 1047 internet users, again aged between fifteen and twenty-five years.

However, there is not sufficient evidence that file sharing systems are responsible for the recent decline in music CD sales. Two previous studies examined micro data of sales and downloads and found mixed results regarding the connection between file sharing and CD sales (Blackburn, 2004; Oberholzer and Strumpf, 2004).\n\nThe current essay estimated the effect of file sharing systems on music CD sales using micro data from Japan in 2004. Japan’s file sharing system (“Winny”) is almost completely decentralized and highly anonymous compared with ones addressed in the two previous studies, thus Japanese users can download music files with less concern about lawsuits. The goal of this research is to examine the effect of file sharing on music CD sales in such an illegal-copy-friendly file sharing system.\n\nBased on micro data of CD sales and numbers of downloads, we found that there was very little evidence that file sharing reduces music CD sales in Japan. We controlled simultaneous bias between sales and downloads by instrumental variables, but did not find correlation between CD sales and numbers of downloads. Although there were large differences in the numbers of downloads among CD titles, these differences did not affect CD sales. We also carried out a user survey on file sharing and CD purchases with consideration to the potential bias of respondents trying to understate their illegal copying activity. This survey also showed that file sharing had very limited influence on CD purchases.','Japanese file sharing system: \"Winny\" allows users to download illegal music files anonymously and free of charge. This study examined the extent of any correlation between the use of Winny and legitimate music CD sales in Japan.

A laboratory experiment with 54 subjects was conducted, in which each subject was told to participate in a software quality evaluation exercise. However, a ploy was carried out to measure the subjects’ intention in software piracy under different levels of group pressure and financial gains. The results are interesting. On the intention of softlifting, both group pressure and financial gains are significant determinants. The interaction of group pressure and financial gains is also significant: when group pressure is toward pirating software, financial gains is not a relevant factor; whereas when group pressure is toward purchasing, financial gains becomes a dominant factor in softlifting intention. A further survey (with 216 college students from two public universities in Taiwan) designed to investigate the relationship between consumer susceptibility to interpersonal influence (Bearden et al., 1989) and softlifting intention/behavior.

But the group pressure and price of software consistently influence people’s intention of copying respectively. \n\n- In study two:\n\n* The norms that a group forms determine an individual’s softlifting intention rather than the information that a group provides. This implies that interpersonal influence is related to softlifting intention, rather than softlifting behavior directly. \n\n* Normative influence is more powerful than informational influence in shaping peers’ intention and behavior.','- Cultivating a social norm with group pressure toward purchasing software should be something to think about. \n\n- Software pricing policy is another important agenda for inhibiting software piracy.

Industry efforts to attenuate the practice, often deterrent in nature, have largely failed. We propose that one reason for this failure is the absence of a commensurably accepted model of the social psychological foundations underlying digital piracy behaviors. A modified version of Perugini and Bagozzi\'s (2001) Model of Goal Directed Behavior is advocated and empirically validated across both movie and music industry settings for this purpose. The results support the theoretical and empirical efficacy of the proposed model and highlight the importance of attitudes toward the act of digital piracy, the frequency of past digital piracy behaviors, and the motivations and intentions underlying digital piracy. A normative framework is proposed with five actionable recommendations to assist digital service marketers in better addressing digital piracy. The research implications of the reported study are also presented and discussed.','- The issue of digital piracy (DP) continues to perplex music, movie, and software service marketers. The authors argue that one reason for this is the lack of a clear understanding of the social psychological underpinnings of DP behaviors.\n\n- A firm understanding of the social psychological model underlying DP appears to be a prerequisite for the development of efficacious marketing communication strategies designed to persuade individuals to attenuate their DP activities.\n\n- This study provide a roadmap to guide service marketers in meeting this challenge by focusing on marketing persuasion strategies that specifically affect the motivations, the attitudes underlying such motivations, and the Frequency of Past Behavior in engaging in DP.\n\n- Overall, the results support further consideration of attitudinal explanations of goal-directed behaviors and suggest that a great deal is yet to be learned in terms of developing effective methods of persuading individuals to not engage in DP.','First, there exists a real need for industry-wide (and perhaps even cross-industry) development and adoption of coordinated integrated marketing communication strategies. Second, the current focus on deterrent strategies appears relatively ineffective and in fact may be strengthening the will to engage in DP. So, consistent with the first recommendation, it appears judicious to begin trying to identify successful means of persuading stakeholders to not engage in DP. Third, it is important to recognize the need to simultaneously target elementary and middleschool students as part of the overall communication strategy. Fourth, some effort has to be undertaken to begin the process of managing the overall images of the involved industries as well.

The new options exist in the context of older traditions such as using one’s social networks or traditional media to find content. Based on original data with a sample of college students, we find that while students use digital media to find music new to them, social networks and traditional media continue to play a very important role in the course of exploration. We also find that digital technology is used differently by different types of music consumers and draw distinctions between peer-to-peer services and browsing, with the former more likely to be used by students from higher socio-economic backgrounds who are opinion leaders in the realm of music. We conclude with observations about the nature of opinion leadership and music and argue that future research should examine more closely the links among the discovery and sharing of culture, opinion leadership and social recognition and status.','* By far, the most common methods for finding new music either involve relying on recommendations from people in one’s social network or on content encountered through traditional mainstream media. \n* Women are less likely to use technology to discover new music than men and 2.75 times more likely to use social networks. \n* Students who listen to a greater number of artists are more likely to use technology to find new music. \n* Heavy web users, while not more likely to browse the Internet in search of new music, are more likely to use peer-to-peer services. \n* Opinion leaders, or mavens, aid in the discovery of new music who receive many recommendations from others and recommend music to other people on a regular basis.

By focusing only on the IPR-intensive industries, this study arguably understates the real contribution of IP rights to the European economy.\n\nSuch IPR-intensive industries are shown to have generated almost 26% of all jobs in the EU during\nthe period 2008-2010, with almost 21% in trade mark-intensive industries, 12% in design-intensive\nindustries, 10% in patent-intensive industries, and smaller proportions in copyright-intensive and GI-intensive industries.6 On average over this period, 56.5 million Europeans were employed by IPR-intensive industries, out of a total employment of approximately 218 million. In addition, another 20 million jobs were generated in industries that supply goods and services to the IPR-intensive industries. Taking indirect jobs into account, the total number of IPR‑dependent jobs rises to just under 77 million (35.1%).\n\nOver the same period, IPR-intensive industries generated almost 39% of total economic activity\n(GDP) in the EU, worth € 4.7 trillion. They also accounted for most of the EU’s trade with the rest of the world, with design-intensive, copyright-intensive and GI-intensive industries generating a trade surplus. IPR-intensive industries also pay significantly higher wages than other industries, with a wage premium of more than 40%. This is consistent with the fact that the value added per worker is higher in IPR-intensive industries than elsewhere in the economy.\n\nIn addition to their direct employment contribution, IPR-intensive industries also generate employment in other, non‑IPR-intensive industries which supply them with goods and services as inputs to their production processes. Using the EU27 Input Output Tables, published by Eurostat, it is possible to calculate this indirect effect on employment in non‑IPR‑intensive industries. The result is summarised in table 2, which shows a breakdown by direct and indirect employment. Including the indirect jobs in the calculation implies that 35.1% of EU jobs are contributed by the IPR-intensive industries, directly and indirectly.\n\nBesides employment, IPR-intensive industries contribute to economic output, as measured by Gross Domestic Product (GDP). Overall, almost 39% of EU GDP is generated in IPR-intensive industries, with trade mark-intensive industries accounting for 34%, design-intensive industries for 13%, patent-intensive industries for 14% and copyright and GI-intensive industries for smaller proportions. Chapter 6 provides a more detailed breakdown of these industries’ contributions to the national economies of the EU Member States.\n\nComparing the results of this EU study with those for the US reveals that the two economies have a similar structure, as is to be expected given their similar level of development. However, in terms of the contribution of IPR-intensive industries, the shares in employment and GDP are somewhat higher in the EU: 26% vs. 19% for employment and 39% vs. 35% for GDP. However, in both studies, trade mark-intensive industries account for the highest shares in both employment and GDP, followed by patents and copyright in the US and by designs, patents and copyright in the EU. Similarly, the wage premiums in IPR-intensive industries compared to other industries are similar: 41% in the EU and 42% in the US, with copyright-intensive and patent intensive industries having the highest premiums on both sides of the Atlantic.\nGiven that 39% of GDP (value added) in the economy and 26% of employment is generated in IPRintensive industries, the value added per employee is higher in IPR-intensive industries than in the rest of the economy. Economic theory suggests that, all else being equal, industries in which the average worker produces more value added can be expected to pay their workers higher wages than other industries. It is therefore of relevance to examine whether this higher value added is reflected in the relative wages in the IPR‑intensive industries.\n\nWages in IPR-intensive industries are indeed higher than in non-IPR‑intensive industries. The average weekly wage in IPR-intensive industries is € 715, compared with € 507 in non‑IPR‑intensive industries – a difference of 41%. This “wage premium” is 31% in design-intensive industries, 42% in trade mark-intensive industries, 46% in GI-intensive industries, 64% in patent-intensive industries and 69% in copyright-intensive industries.\n\nFinally, the role played by IPR-intensive industries in the EU’s external trade is examined. The bulk of EU trade is in IPR-intensive industries. It may be somewhat surprising at first glance that such a high share of imports is IPR-intensive. This is because even industries producing commodities such as energy are IPR-intensive, while on the other hand, many non-IPR-intensive activities are also non-tradable. For that reason, 88% of EU imports consist of products of IPR-intensive industries.\n\nHowever, an even higher share of EU exports, 90% is accounted for by IPR-intensive industries. The EU as a whole had a trade deficit of approximately €174 billion, or 1.4% of GDP. Since the IPR-intensive industries as a whole account for a higher share of EU exports than EU imports, they make a positive contribution to the Union’s trade position. The EU has a trade deficit in trademark-intensive and patent-intensive products, to some degree offset by trade surpluses in copyright intensive, design-intensive, and GI-intensive industries.','It makes no policy recommendations, as this is not within its scope.

Is it possible to identify a creative workforce and to assess its contribution to the Australian economy? And are these workers employed in sectors of the economy that could be thought of as the creative industries? \n* Creative class:  A lot of attention has been focused recently on the proposition that creative people tend to cluster in particular urban environments, stimulating economic growth and social interaction. Such people have been referred to as a ‘creative class’. Does this concept have any relevance to cities in Australia? And can we describe any of the State or Territory capitals as a ‘creative city’? \n* Creative participation:  Australians spend their leisure time in a variety of ways, many of which could be referred to as creative. Active involvement in the arts, through painting, singing, playing a musical instrument, writing, dancing and so on all involve the development and application of creative skills. Moreover, participation in the arts as a consumer—visiting art galleries, reading novels, going to the theatre—all involve a form of creative engagement. How important are such activities in Australian life today?\n\nThis paper addresses all three of these aspects of creativity in Australian society at the present time. The central proposition to be explored is that the somewhat vague idea of Creative Australia can indeed be given conceptual and empirical substance, thanks particularly to the rich sources of data provided by the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS). Quite a lot is already known about many statistical aspects of the arts and culture in Australia as a result of the longstanding efforts of the Statistics Working Group of the Cultural Ministers’ Council and the dedicated work of the National Centre for Culture and Recreation Statistics of the ABS located in Adelaide. But in addition to these sources, access to the Census results provides a unique opportunity to shed light on aspects of our topic that can only be effectively studied using data collected under the rigorous methodology and comprehensive coverage of the Australian Census','* In looking at the characteristics of the creative workforce in Australia, we can ask whether the numbers of creative workers have grown over the last ten years. Comparative data from the 1996, 2001 and 2006 Censuses can be used to examine changes over this period. These data indicate that the size of the creative workforce as defined above grew by almost 40 per cent in the period 1996–2006, a compound growth rate of about 3 per cent per annum. The growth was particularly spurred by increases in numbers in the design professions, which grew at an annual rate of about 6 per cent. The growth in the creative workforce is reflective of structural changes that have been occurring in the economy in recent years, as traditional manufacturing and service industries gradually give way to information and knowledge-based industries in the socalled new economy. Technological changes in communications and information processing have contributed significantly to these shifts, and the consequences can be observed in employment levels. For example, the increase in numbers in the design professions noted above can be contrasted with the decline in more traditional areas such as printing; the numbers of printing tradespeople have fallen by 25 per cent over the last decade.   \n\n* In regard to the importance of creativity in economic life, the author has noted the growing interest in the world at large in the emerging concept of the creative economy, centred on the creative or cultural industries. Australia has experienced somewhat the same patterns of growth in its creative sector as have other countries, when observed in terms of contribution to GDP or to employment. To some extent this has happened without significant policy intervention, at least at the Federal level; the grand 1990s vision of Creative Nation was not pursued by the Commonwealth Government after 1996, and initiatives to promote cultural industry development over the last decade have mainly arisen at State level, as a component of urban and regional policy—in particular the rhetoric of ‘creative cities’ has been enthusiastically espoused around the country, and this shows no signs of abating. Thus although Australia may not unequivocally be described as a creative economy at the present time, there are certainly elements in the system which are pointing in that direction. But a stronger policy involvement, especially at the Federal level, is likely to be needed in the future if Australia is to maintain or enhance its established and emerging strengths in the development of creative skills across the economy at large. \n\n*The core components of the country’s cultural sector—the creative artists, the performing companies, the galleries, museums and libraries, the heritage sites, and the public broadcasting system—are all well-established. Despite periodic fluctuations across the political cycle, bipartisan support for public funding provided for cultural purposes by Federal, State and local governments remains reasonably stable.51 Nevertheless the per capita levels of such funding are by no means generous in comparison with other countries of comparable wealth. \n\n*This project provides a vivid illustration of the value of the Census in shedding light on aspects of contemporary Australian society. Census data, of course, have the enormous advantage of comprehensiveness and accuracy, avoiding the problems of sampling bias and difficulties of statistical inference that characterise the use of data derived from surveys. In the present project the identification of the creative workforce has been a central task, made possible by the fact that the Census provides labour market data to a high degree of occupational specificity, together with industry definitions that enable the clear delineation of the cultural sector of the economy. In addition, the ability to trace locational aspects to the finest level of disaggregation has allowed the testing of hypotheses concerning the existence of so-called creative cities in various parts of the country. Future Censuses are likely to be even more useful in their application to analysis of the cultural sector if the revised framework for cultural statistics currently being developed at an international level is finally agreed upon and adopted in Australia.','* At the 2020 Ideas Summit mentioned in the Introduction to this paper, a major theme pursued by the Creative Australia group focused on the centrality of creativity to Australian society and the Australian economy. The group put forward a number of policy directions for education, for funding, for Indigenous art, for the creative industries and for international relations, to name only a few. If these sorts of ideas are taken up, not just by governments but more widely across the community, the concept of Creative Australia is likely to grow in strength and recognition in the coming years.','http://www.assa.edu.au/publications/occasional/2008_CS1_Creative_Australia.pdf','http://www.assa.edu.au/publications/occasional/2008_CS1_Creative_Australia.pdf',0,0,0,'The essay is an analysis on the 2006 Census, regardin 156,000 workers in the creative industry in Australia'),('Throsby_and_Zednik_(2010)','Throsby and Zednik (2010)','http://www.copyrightevidence.org/evidence-wiki/index.php/Throsby_and_Zednik_(2010)',2010,'Do You Really Expect To Get Paid?: An Economic Study of Professional Artists in Australia','This study reports the findings of the latest in a series of 5 surveys, conducted between 1983 and 2009, reporting the economic circumstances of professional artists.

Secondly, this approach is applied to a specific topic, the change in copyright law in the form of the introduction of a new property right for performers in the UK that has come about as a result of the harmonisation programme of the European Union. Finally, new data were collected to assess the likely impact this change in law would have on performers\' earnings using the music industry as a case study.

On the one hand, copyright law was ineffectual in controlling piracy throughout the 19th century and on the other hand, performing rights were ignored by music publishers for over 70 years; these points suggest that copyright was not the main reason behind the success of the industry. Rather than leading entrepreneurially (the current view of dynamism in the creative industries), publishers ‘followed the money’ and adapted their business models only when new streams of income from new forms of exploitation through sound recording, broadcasting and film became available as a result of exogenous technical progress. Publishers were locked-in to sales revenue as their business model, though when switching to the new business model of rights management took place, the costs seem not to have been greatly significant.\n\nThe paper takes an historical approach to the development of music publishing viewed through the lens of present day issues. The research has resonance for the transition from sales to licensing digital works that is taking place in the creative industries today and puts into perspective the relative significance of market forces and copyright law in the process.','The huge outlay on IT investment needed to keep track of digital use suggests that large\nenterprises will benefit from network and scale economies; large scale enterprises also are\nbetter able to pool risk and finance potential loss in superstar markets like those of music\npublishing.

This Article challenges the conventional wisdom propounded by the U.S. and German governments, as well as Microsoft and other competitors of Google, concerning the likely economic impact of mass book-digitization projects. Originally advanced by publishing industry lobbying groups, the prevailing account of mass book-digitization projects is that they will devastate authors and publishers, just as Napster and its heirs have supposedly devastated musicians and music labels. Using the impact of GBS on the revenues and operating incomes of U.S. publishers believing themselves to be the most-affected by it, this Article finds no evidence of a negative impact upon them. To the contrary, it provides some evidence of a positive impact, and proposes further empirical research to identify the mechanisms of digitization’s economic impact. \n\nThe debate surrounding the GBS settlement is important to students, writers, researchers, and the general public, as it may decide whether a federal appellate court or even the U.S. Supreme Court allows the best research tool ever designed to survive. If the theory of Microsoft and some publishing trade associations is accepted, the courts may enjoin and destroy GBS, just as Napster was shut down a decade ago. \n\nThe Article aims at a preliminary estimate of the economic impact of mass digitization projects, using GBS as a case in point. It finds little support for the much-discussed hypothesis of the Association of American Publishers and Google’s competitors that the mass digitization of major U.S. libraries will reduce the revenues and profits of the most-affected publishers. In fact, the revenues and profits of the publishers who believe themselves to be most aggrieved by GBS, as measured by their willingness to file suit against Google for copyright infringement, increased at a faster rate after the project began, as compared to before its commencement. The rate of growth by publishers most affected by GBS is greater than the growth of the overall U.S. economy or of retail sales. Thus, the very publishers that have sued Google have seen their revenues grow faster than retail sales or the U.S. economy as a whole (measured by gross domestic product). This finding parallels some of the research that has been done since the Napster case on the economic impact of peer-to-peer file sharing on sales of recorded music. Future studies may provide a more granular estimate of the economic impact of frequent downloads or displays of pages of particular books on the sales of such books.','The article aims at a preliminary estimate of the economic impact of mass digitization projects, using GBS as a case in point.

If the Napster analogy is\naccepted, the tendency of the courts and Congress may be to treat computer users, search engines, massively multiplayer online role playing games, digital libraries, and bloggers quoting news stories as infringing,\nand shut them down or revamp them with publishing industry control over their features, limitations, and level of interactivity.

Publishers subjected to it on a massive scale have seen their revenues and profits soar. They are racing past the economy as a whole. One way in which mass digitization may impact the publishing industry beneficially is by vastly expanding public and competitor access to not only substantive knowledge in general, but knowledge about books, the book market, and book prices in particular.

Realizing this dream-creating a digital library that is comparable to an excellent traditional library and providing open access to it,- require negotiating copyright permission. \nThis report focuses on three efforts at Carnegie Mellon University to acquire copyright permission to digitize and provide open access to books-that is, to make books freely available on the Internet for public use. \nTo provide a context for the studies that form the basis of this report, the report begins with an overview of copyright laws, licensing practices, and technological developments that have brought about dramatic changes in the cost and dissemination of scholarly information. This section also describes the impact that these changes have had on research, learning, and libraries. The three studies, including data analyses that explore the response and success rates with different types of publishers and publications and transaction costs, are then presented in detail. Anecdotes illuminate the effort required and problems encountered in trying to acquire copyright permission for open access, from the difficulty of determining copyright status and ownership and locating copyright owners to the questions, concerns, record-keeping methods, and changing contractual practices that constrain publishers\' embrace of open access. The report describes how lessons learned in each study were applied in the next study and the benefits of flexible and innovative approaches to acquiring copyright permission.','The random sample feasibility study revealed that it is indeed possible to secure permission to digitize and provide open access to books, but the work is tedious and often comes to naught. The authors learned that even determining the copyright status of a book can be difficult and time-consuming.\n\nThe Posner project confirmed the authors belief that it is possible to secure copyright permission to digitize books and to provide open access to them on the Web. It also confirmed what they had learned in the feasibility study about how difficult and time-consuming it is to determine copyright status and to identify and locate copyright holders, particularly authors and estates. However, by dedicating personnel and adjusting our processes, they significantly reduced the cost per title for which permission was granted. Further adjustments to their workflow or refinements to their negotiation strategies could yield even greater cost savings.\n\nFrom the expense and difficulty of determining copyright status and locating the owner to the struggle to get a response from a publisher when seeking permission to digitize for scholarly use, this timely report provides a detailed account of the challenges facing libraries today. It should be of practical use to publishers and librarians alike as we try to navigate the current situation and work to improve it, through such innovations as the “orphaned works” legislation that is currently under discussion.','What are the stumbling blocks to digitization?

It analyses the conditions of the commercialization of music in an industry structure with, and without, a copyright regime. The paper\'s main concern is with the relationship between artists and publishers. The particular influence of the continental European, especially Austrian, copyright regime on the contractual design of publishing contracts and the music industry structure, and their differences from US norms, is discussed.','Music publishers lobbied for copyright legislation and created collecting societies  in order to exploit artists creative inputs using contracts which granted the publishers exclusive rights over the inputs.\n\nCopyright regime , in music publishing, leads to monopolistic competition,  oligopolistic structures and asymmetric market power on the side of music publishers.\nThe stronger party will dictate the terms of the agreement s thus contracts will include clauses which lead to dependence of authors on publishers/record companies.  \n\nThe rights of authors  granted by copyright will be expropriated if not protected by contractual law.\n\nIf contracts do not formally grant moral and financial rights and restrict potential exploitation gatekeepers will regulate innovation driving production to more of the same compared to creative experiments.','The author concluded that legislators should reconsider the protective copyright legislation and replace it with laws that  formally award moral and financial rights to the creator and restrict the potential expropriation of intellectual property rights by contracting terms.','http://www.researchgate.net/publication/250889461_COPYRIGHT_CONTRACTS_AND_MUSIC_PRODUCTION','http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/13691180802459971#.VbVGUfmCfIU',1,0,1,'The author references and discusses  gatekeeping in the music industry, artist-publisher relationship, and contracts and (music) industry structure in context of area specific evidence in the fields literature.'),('Tzantzara_and_Economides_(2010)','Tzantzara and Economides (2010)','http://www.copyrightevidence.org/evidence-wiki/index.php/Tzantzara_and_Economides_(2010)',2010,'Gender differences in digital music distribution methods','This study examines gender differences among Greek Internet users in using digital music distribution methods.

See Pub. L. No. 111-175, 124 Stat. 1218 (2010) (hereinafter “STELA”). The legislation extended the term of the Section 119 satellite distant signal statutory license for another five years, modified the Section 111 cable statutory license and the Section 122 satellite local-into-local statutory license in several respects, and provided updates to account for changes resulting from the nationwide transition to digital television. STELA also directed the Register of Copyrights (hereinafter “Copyright Office” or “Office”) to submit recommendations to Congress to achieve the phase-out and eventual repeal of Sections 111, 119, and 122, including proposals for timing and marketplace alternatives.\nIn these proceedings, the Office floated three broad alternatives to the statutory\nlicenses currently in place: (1) sublicensing; (2) collective licensing; and (3) direct licensing, and explored with stakeholders certain fundamental questions – among these, how such options might function in an open marketplace and the benefits and drawbacks of each model. The proceedings also highlighted the fact that, although the statutory licenses at issue are copyright provisions, they are intertwined with equally complex provisions of communications law and policy – the implications of which are outside the expertise of the Copyright Office and require further consideration by Congress.','The Office supports a free market for licensing the retransmission of broadcast\ntelevision programming, finds that there are workable marketplace alternatives to the existing statutory licensing system, and suggests a phase-out approach that not only respects the rights of subscribers but also recognizes the concerns of all the affected parties. The recommendations set forth herein reflect all of these considerations.The Copyright Office hereby makes the following recommendations to effectuate a phase-out of\nthe statutory licenses:\n\n• Copyright owners should be permitted to develop marketplace licensing options to replace the provisions of Sections 111, 119 and 122, working with broadcasters, cable operators, satellite carriers, and other licensees, while taking into account consumer demands.\n\n• Business models based on sublicensing, collective licensing and/or direct licensing are largely undeveloped in the broadcast retransmission context, but they are feasible alternatives to securing the public performance rights necessary to retransmit copyrighted content.\n\n• The options of sublicensing, collective licensing, and direct licensing do not represent the entire universe of possibilities, are not mutually exclusive, and will not remain static. Business models may emerge that incorporate these concepts in part or in combination, and technology will continuously inform the practices of both licensors and licensees. Over time, marketplace licensing should evolve in a variety of innovative ways, subject to investment and experimentation in the marketplace.\n\n• The Copyright Office recommends that Congress provide a date-specific trigger for the phase-out and eventual repeal of the distant signal licenses, building in sufficient time for a measured and orderly transition period.\n\n• Before determining the date-specific trigger and transition period for the phase-out of the distant signal licenses, the Copyright Office recommends that Congress evaluate the concerns of stakeholders who operate with limited resources in the broadcast programming distribution chain and determine whether special consideration is advisable.\n\n• During the transition period, the Section 111, 119, and 122 statutory licenses should not apply to any broadcast station that has obtained the rights to retransmit all of the content carried on its signal, provided that the local broadcast station forgoes its mandatory carriage rights under the United States Copyright Office STELA § 302 REPORT 140 must-carry and carry-one carry-all provisions of the Communications Act. This “station-bystation” option would apply to all broadcast stations, including those in distant markets. Under this option, MVPDs would be required to negotiate directly with the broadcast station for carriage of the programming on the broadcast signal.\n\n• The Copyright Office recommends that Congress delay the phase-out and repeal of the local\nsignal licenses to a later time. This approach would provide stakeholders with an opportunity to test new business models with the least likelihood of disruption to consumers, and give Congress the advantage of drawing on that experience when considering when and how to address the local signal licenses.\n\n• The Copyright Office recommends that Congress carefully consider the communications law and\npolicy implications of repealing the statutory licensing system.','* The Copyright Office recommends that Congress provide a date-specific trigger for the phase-out and eventual repeal of the distant signal licenses, but leave repeal of the local signal licenses to a later time.

Indeed, U.S. copyright law derives\nfundamentally from the principle that authors’ interests are inseparable from the broader public interest. While “[t]he immediate effect of our copyright law is to secure a fair return for an ‘author’s’ creative labor,” the “ultimate aim is . . . to stimulate artistic creativity for the general public good.” Accordingly, to the extent that the current copyright system is not working effectively for authors – or is disfavoring a discrete class of authors – Congress should be concerned.\n\nIn the framework of the resale royalty discussions, the authors at issue are certain visual\nartists, including painters, illustrators, sculptors, and photographers (hereinafter “visual artists” or “artists”). Based on the information and comments provided during the preparation of this report, as well as the Office’s independent research, the Office agrees that, under the current legal system, visual artists are uniquely limited in their ability to fully benefit from the success of their works over time. The distinctive nature of the creation and marketing of visual art has not changed since the Office’s main study on the topic, published in 1992. At the same time, recent developments – including in particular the adoption of resale royalty laws by more than thirty additional countries since the Office’s prior report – would seem to warrant renewed consideration of the issue.\n\nIn general, visual artists do not share in the long-term financial success of their works.\nInstead, the financial gains from the resale of their works inure primarily to third parties such as auction houses, collectors, and art galleries. Moreover, the income typically available to other authors through reproduction and derivative uses of their works is more limited for artists. Although the Internet has provided artists with greater opportunities to exploit derivative images and/or sell mass-produced copies of their works, stakeholders agree that “for most visual artists . . . the amounts involved in reproduction or representation are generally insignificant.” Indeed, it appears to be common ground that reproduction rights represent a “very minor aspect of [most artists’] careers” and that the first sale of a work is “the main or exclusive source of income for almost all American artists.”\n\nThe Copyright Office agrees that these factors place many visual artists at a material\ndisadvantage vis-à-vis other authors, and therefore the Office supports congressional\nconsideration of a resale royalty right, or droit de suite,8 which would give artists a percentage of the amount paid for a work each time it is resold by another party. A large and growing number of countries around the world – more than seventy in total – now follow that approach. Other potential responses might include the facilitation of voluntary initiatives among stakeholders in the art market, amending the copyright law to give artists a continuing economic interest in their works through, for example, greater interests in public display or commercial rental rights, and increased federal grants for visual art programs. \n\nThat said, an “information problem” in the art market – something that many have acknowledged – does present certain challenges. Any assessment of the treatment of visual artists under U.S. law suffers from a lack of independently verifiable data about the operation of the art market and a resulting difficulty in determining whether a resale royalty in particular would truly operate to place artists on equal footing with other authors. At the same time, the Office recognizes that many of the arguments against the right are overblown. Moreover, according to the most recent studies, a number of the adverse consequences that this Office’s previous report predicted might follow from implementation of the right have not materialized in countries that have adopted droit de suite since that time. Accordingly, the Office finds no clear impediment to implementation of a resale royalty right in the United States and supports the right as one alternative to address the disparity in treatment of artists under the copyright law.','• Although visual artists possess the same exclusive rights under copyright law as other\nauthors, they are disadvantaged as a practical matter by certain factors endemic to the\ncreation of works that are produced in singular form (or in very limited copies) and are\nvalued for their scarcity. There are sound policy reasons to address this inequity,\nincluding the constitutionally-rooted objective to incentivize the creation and\ndissemination of artistic works.\n\n• While a resale royalty could be one of many factors affecting the location of auctions and other art sales, there is no evidence to conclusively establish that it would harm the U.S.visual art market. Studies produced since this Office last examined the issue in 1992\nbelie earlier assumptions that a resale royalty would substantially reduce prices in the\nprimary art market or shift the secondary art market away from the United States.\n\n• Although adoption of a resale royalty right is one option to address the disparate\ntreatment of artists under the law, it is not the only option, and more deliberation is\nnecessary to determine if it is the best option. The Office’s 1992 report highlighted the\nfact that resale royalties appear to benefit only an extremely small number of artists.\nCurrent studies and reports remain consistent with this view. In light of the potentially\nlimited benefits, the costs of the law (e.g., administration and enforcement), while not\ninsurmountable, suggest that Congress should approach this issue with some caution.','Should Congress wish to adopt a resale royalty right in the United States, the Office\nrecommends that the legislation:\no Apply to sales of works of visual art by auction houses, galleries, private dealers, and other persons and entities engaged in the business of selling visual art;\no Include a relatively low threshold value to ensure that the royalty benefits as many artists as possible;\no Establish a royalty rate of 3 percent to 5 percent of the work’s gross resale price (i.e., a range generally in line with royalty rates in several other countries) for those works that have increased in value;\no Include a cap on the royalty payment available from each sale;\no Apply prospectively to the resale of works acquired after the law takes effect;\no Provide for collective management by private collecting societies, with general oversight by the U.S. Copyright Office;\no Require copyright registration as a prerequisite to receiving royalties;\no Limit remedies to a specified monetary payment rather than actual or statutory damages;\no At least initially, apply only for a term of the life of the artist; and\no Require a Copyright Office study of the effect of the royalty on artists and the art\nmarket within a reasonable time after enactment.','http://copyright.gov/docs/resaleroyalty/usco-resaleroyalty.pdf','http://copyright.gov/docs/resaleroyalty/usco-resaleroyalty.pdf',1,0,1,'2012 call for comment, to which 58 stakeholder parties responded, and 2013 roundtable, led by the Honorable Jerrold Nadler, U.S. House of Representatives, with four panels of 9 to 12 stakeholder representatives each.'),('United_States_Copyright_Office_(2013b)','United States Copyright Office (2013b)','http://www.copyrightevidence.org/evidence-wiki/index.php/United_States_Copyright_Office_(2013b)',2013,'Copyright Small Claims','As provided in the Constitution, the rights granted to authors are not merely to be articulated, but also “secur[ed].\" Unfortunately, and perhaps ironically, as the rate of infringement has increased, so too have the barriers to pursuing copyright claims in the federal courts. These barriers are largely practical: federal litigation is expensive and time-consuming, and therefore out of reach for many copyright owners. The problem is especially vexing in the context of small claims, where the injury may be limited or difficult to measure. If exclusive rights are unenforceable, they are weakened as the pillars of the copyright law, and public respect for our nation’s creativity is eroded in turn. The problem of modest-sized copyright claims, on the one hand, and costly enforcement, on the other, appears to be especially acute for individual creators. \n\nIn comments submitted to the Copyright Office in the course of this study, the Graphic Artists Guild wrote that “[a]s a practical matter, except for large corporate copyright owners, our current copyright laws are virtually unenforceable when it comes to the infringement of visual works.” In a similar vein, American Photographic Artists explained that “the current system deters authors from asserting their rights, renders these cases difficult for any attorney to take on, and encourages copyright infringement by all phases of society.” The Alliance for Visual Artists pointed out that “[t]he traditional method of protecting copyrights … is simply impracticable for a small business photographer with limited income.” Observing that “[w]e weaken markets for valuable goods at our collective peril,” the Authors Guild reported that a majority of authors surveyed saw the need forthat while “[s]uch small claims and random infringements may seem unimportant, … taken in the aggregate, they have an effect on the livelihoods of individual creators akin to the infamous torture ‘death by a thousand cuts.’” \n\nCreators are not alone in voicing these concerns. Citing the “hindrances that currently exist in preventing copyright owners from pursuing copyright claims of relatively small economic value,” the American Bar Association’s Section of Intellectual Property Law offered recommendations in support of “a much needed avenue for small copyright claims adjudication.” Organizations that provide pro bono assistance to lower-income artists, such as California Lawyers for the Arts and the New York-based Volunteer Lawyers for the Arts, emphasized what they saw as a pressing need for alternatives to federal litigation. \n\nFinally, the frustrations of those seeking to defend against claims of infringement – who\nthemselves may be smaller actors and who also face high litigation costs – cannot be overlooked. The Copyright Office trusts that the findings and recommendations of this Report will be helpful to Congress as it continues to explore the issue of small copyright claims.','In brief summary, the Report makes the following recommendations:\n\n• Congress should create a centralized tribunal within the Copyright Office, which would\nadminister proceedings through online and teleconferencing facilities without the\nrequirement of personal appearances. The tribunal would be staffed by three\nadjudicators, two of whom would have significant experience in copyright law – together\nhaving represented or presided over the interests of both owners and users of copyrighted\nworks – with the third to have a background in alternative dispute resolution.\n\n• The tribunal would be a voluntary alternative to federal court. Its focus would be on\nsmall infringement cases valued at no more than $30,000 in damages. Copyright owners\nwould be required to have registered their works or filed an application before bringing\nan action. They would be eligible to recover either actual or statutory damages up to the\n$30,000 cap, but statutory damages would be limited to $15,000 per work (or $7,500 for\na work not registered by the normally applicable deadline for statutory damages).\n\n• Claimants who initiated a proceeding would provide notice of the claim to responding\nparties, who would need to agree to the process, either through an opt-out mechanism or\nby affirmative written consent. Respondents would be permitted to assert all relevant\ndefenses, including fair use, as well as limited counterclaims arising from the infringing\nconduct at issue. Certain DMCA-related matters relating to takedown notices, including\nclaims of misrepresentation, could also be considered, and parties threatened with an\ninfringement action could seek a declaration of noninfringement.\n\n• Parties would provide written submissions and hearings would be conducted through\ntelecommunications facilities. Proceedings would be streamlined, with limited discovery\nand no formal motion practice. A responding party’s agreement to cease infringing\nactivity could be considered by the tribunal and reflected in its determination. The\ntribunal would retain the discretion to dismiss without prejudice any claim that it did not\nbelieve could fairly be adjudicated through the small claims process.\n\n• Determinations of the small claims tribunal would be binding only with respect to the\nparties and claims at issue and would have no precedential effect. They would be subject\nto limited administrative review for error and could be challenged in federal district court\nfor fraud, misconduct, or other improprieties. Final determinations could be filed in\nfederal court, if necessary, to ensure their enforceability.','Based on input from roundtables and Notices for Inquiry, the Copyright Office recommends the creation of a small claims copyright court to best serve creators and authors.','http://copyright.gov/docs/smallclaims/usco-smallcopyrightclaims.pdf','http://copyright.gov/docs/smallclaims/usco-smallcopyrightclaims.pdf',1,0,1,'In 2012 and 2013, the Copyright Office released three Notices of Inquiry for comment (attracting 55, 25, and 27 stakeholder respondents, respectively).

Our licensing system is founded on a view that the music marketplace requires a unique level of government regulation, much of it reflected in statutory licensing provisions of the Copyright Act. The Copyright Office believes that the time is ripe to question the existing paradigm for the licensing of musical works and sound recordings and consider meaningful change.\n\nThere is a widespread perception that our licensing system is broken. Songwriters and recording artists are concerned that they cannot make a living under the existing structure, which raises serious and systemic concerns for the future. Music publishers and performance rights organizations are frustrated that so much of their licensing activity is subject to government control, so they are constrained in the marketplace. Record labels and digital services complain that the licensing process is burdensome and inefficient, making it difficult to innovate.\n\nWhile there is general consensus that the system needs attention, there is less agreement as to what should be done. In this report, after reviewing the existing framework and stakeholders’ views, the Copyright Office offers a series of guiding principles and preliminary recommendations for change. The Office’s proposals are meant to be contemplated together, rather than individually. With this approach, the Office seeks to present a series of balanced tradeoffs among the interested parties to create a fairer, more efficient, and more rational system for all.','The Copyright Office appreciates and agrees with the four grounding principles that were articulated by many during the course of this study, as discussed above. These are:\n* Music creators should be fairly compensated for their contributions;\n* The licensing process should be more efficient;\n* Market participants should have access to authoritative data to identify and license sound recordings and musical works;\n* Usage and payment information should be transparent and accessible to rightsowners.\n\nAs much as there may be consensus on these points, however, the opposite could be said of stakeholders’ views as to how best to achieve them. Having considered the plethora of issues that plague our current licensing system—and how they might practically be addressed—the Office has identified some additional principles that it believes should also guide any process of reform. These are:\n* Government licensing processes should aspire to treat like uses of music alike;\n* Government supervision should enable voluntary transactions while still supporting collective solutions;\n* Ratesetting and enforcement of antitrust laws should be separately managed and addressed;\n* A single, market‐oriented ratesetting standard should apply to all music uses under statutory licenses.','The report suggests a thorough restructuring of the music licensing system by congressional legislation, a Copyright Office review of the system several years following implementation, and a narrowing or expansion (particularly of \'opt-out\' rights) into other areas of copyright protection, depending on the marketplace effect.  The report recommends broad legislative reform with ample regulatory flexibility.','http://copyright.gov/docs/musiclicensingstudy/copyright-and-the-music-marketplace.pdf','http://copyright.gov/docs/musiclicensingstudy/copyright-and-the-music-marketplace.pdf',0,0,0,'In 2014, 84 individuals, music management companies, legal organisations, and other interested parties responded to the First Notice of Inquiry and 51 to the Second Notice of Inquiry while 78 stakeholders attended roundtables in Los Angeles, New York, and Nashville.'),('United_States_Copyright_Office_(2015)_b','United States Copyright Office (2015) b','http://www.copyrightevidence.org/evidence-wiki/index.php/United_States_Copyright_Office_(2015)_b',2015,'Orphan Works and Mass Digitization','As the Supreme Court reaffirmed in 2012, facilitating the dissemination of creative expression is an important means of facilitating the constitutional mandate to \'promote the Progress of Science.\' This Report addresses two circumstances in which the accomplishment of that goal may be hindered under the current law due to practical obstacles preventing good faith actors from securing permission to make productive uses of copyrighted works.  First, with respect to orphan works, referred to as \'perhaps the single greatest impediment to creating new works,\' a user\'s ability to seek permission or to negotiate licensing terms is compromised by the fact that, despite his or her diligent efforts, the user cannot identify or locate the copyright owner. Second, in the case of mass digitization – which involves making reproductions of many works, as well as possible efforts to make the works publicly accessible – obtaining permission is essentially impossible, not necessarily because of a lack of identifying information or the inability to contact the copyright owner, but because of the sheer number of individual permissions required.','After reviewing stakeholder responses and international systems, the Copyright Office recommends two separate solutions for mass digitization and orphan works.  Due to the widespread problem of receiving permission for orphan work use, the Copyright Office recommends limiting liability on infringement for orphan works after diligent search.  For mass digitization, the issue centres on market efficiency rather than lack of information.  Thus the Copyright Office proposes legislative reform (with regulatory flexibility) based on extended collective licensing.','The proposed orphan works legislative framework would do the following:\n* Establish a limitation on remedies for copyright infringement for eligible users who can prove they have engaged in a good faith diligent search for the owner of a copyright and have been unable to identify or locate him or her;\n* Define a diligent search as, at a minimum, searching Copyright Office records; searching sources of copyright authorship, ownership, and licensing; using technology tools; and using databases, all as reasonable and appropriate under the circumstances; \n* Require the Copyright Office to maintain and update Recommended Practices for diligent searches for various categories of works, through public consultation with interested stakeholders;\n* Add injunction and monetary relief limitations for infringements of orphan works by eligible nonprofit educational institutions, museums, libraries, archives, or public broadcasters, for noncommercial, educational, religious, or charitable purposes, provided the eligible entity promptly ceases the infringing use;\n* Explicitly preserve the ability of users to assert fair use for uses of orphan works.','http://copyright.gov/orphan/reports/orphan-works2015.pdf','http://copyright.gov/orphan/reports/orphan-works2015.pdf',1,0,1,'In 2014, 81 public roundtable participant and 166 responses to Notice of Inquiry were received.

Doing a more detailed check on notices would often result in an assessment of risk of secondary liability in a \"gray\" situation- exactly what OSPs hoped to  avoid through  legal safe harbors.\n\n* In theory, such OSP behaviors might become a consumer choice-point, with consumers  choosing OSPs more likely to resist overbroad takedowns, but the lack of public discussion of this issue suggests that consumers have little awareness of the issue or means to compare OSP behavior on this issue.','Recognizing that significant file-sharing and copyright infringing behavior has shifted from the § 512(c) and (d) environment to the § 512(a) environment, where  the  notice-and-takedown procedures are ineffective, but widely implemented, we recommend Congress evaluate  ways to  provide compensation for copyright holders for unauthorized file-sharing.','http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2210935','http://scholarship.law.berkeley.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1500&context=facpubs',0,0,0,'This study analyzes nearly 900 DMCA (17 USC 512) takedown notices from a variety of sources, including all notices received by Google through 2006.'),('Vacca_(2014)','Vacca (2014)','http://www.copyrightevidence.org/evidence-wiki/index.php/Vacca_(2014)',2014,'Work made for hire – Analyzing the multifactor balancing test','Authorship, and hence, initial ownership of copyrighted works is oftentimes controlled by the 1976 Copyright Act’s work made for hire doctrine. This doctrine states that works created by employees within the scope of their employment result in the employer owning the copyright. One key determination in this analysis is whether the hired party is an employee or independent contractor. In 1989, the U.S. Supreme Court, in CCNV v. Reid, answered the question of how employees are distinguished from independent contractors by setting forth a list of factors courts should consider. Unfortunately, the Supreme Court did not give further guidance on how to balance these factors. Three years later, in 1992, the Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit decided Aymes v. Bonelli and noted that not all factors are equally weighted and that five of the factors would “be significant in virtually every situation.” This analysis was supported by looking at all the work made for hire cases decided in the three year period since Reid – six cases in total. This Article expands in both scope and time what the Second Circuit did in Aymes and systematically analyzes how courts have utilized the factors in the twenty-five years since Reid. In particular, this study has identified the universe of cases where the courts have decided whether a hired party was an employee or independent contractor and uses the data from these cases to describe what factors appear to be the most and least important in reaching these conclusions. Based on the results of this study, this Article proposes a continuum of importance, which graphically illustrates the relative importance of each factor.','* Although the Supreme Court cast the rejected “right to control” test as focusing on controlling the product as opposed to controlling the manner and means of production, it is questionable whether there is a meaningful difference between them.\n\n* Even assuming the Supreme Court had correctly understood the “right to control” test, the results of this study suggest that the right to control is unimportant.\n\n* The Supreme Court’s rejection of the “right to control” test is consistent with the results of this study. However, because the Supreme Court misunderstood the test, the reason for the consistency has little to do with the Court’s rationale for rejecting the test.\n\n* The results of this study should assist attorneys in evaluating their clients’ cases and giving more informed recommendations about whether to settle a dispute and for how much. Focusing on the most important factors can provide increased predictability and certainty.','In the event Congress has the opportunity to revisit the work made for hire doctrine and believes predictability and certainty are still valuable goals vis à vis copyright ownership, then perhaps Congress could provide more guidance as to what constitutes an employer-employee relationship by recognizing these factors as existing in tiers.','http://ssrn.com/abstract=2405015','http://ideaexchange.uakron.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1225&context=ua_law_publications',0,0,0,'The author located all of the work made for hire cases decided under the 1976 Copyright Act from June 5\n1989 through February 27 2014, which yielded a total of 46 cases.'),('Van_Eijk,_Poort_and_Rutten_(2010)','Van Eijk, Poort and Rutten (2010)','http://www.copyrightevidence.org/evidence-wiki/index.php/Van_Eijk,_Poort_and_Rutten_(2010)',2010,'Legal, Economic and Cultural Aspects of File Sharing','This contribution seeks to identify the short and long-term economic and cultural effects of file sharing on music, films and games, while taking into account the legal context and policy developments. The short-term implications examined concern direct costs and benefits to society, whereas the long-term impact concerns changes in the industry\'s business models as well as in cultural diversity and the accessibility of content. It observes that the proliferation of digital distribution networks combined with the availability of digital technology among consumers has broken the entertainment industries\' control over the access to their products. Only part of the decline in music sales can be attributed to file sharing. Despite the losses for the music industry, the increased accessibillity of culture renders the overall welfare effects of file sharing robustly positive. As a consequence the entertainment industries, particularly the music industry, have to explore new models to sustain their business.','The main results of the study:\n\n*Turnover in the recorded music industry is in decline, but only part of this decline can be attributed to file sharing. \n\n*Conversely, only a small fraction of the content exchanged through file sharing networks comes at the expense of industry turnover. This renders the overall welfare effects of file sharing robustly positive.\n\n*For example, the authors state that the consumer surplus created by music sharing in the Netherlands amounts to an estimated minimum of €200 million per year; a conservative estimate. At most half this amount is generated at the expense of the producer surplus and therefore constitutes a transfer of welfare. The remainder constitutes welfare gains.\n\n*The film industry is feeling the file-sharing pain less than is the music business, but this looks about to change as broadband is rolled out further. \n\n*The \'digitally native\' games industry would seem better positioned to respond to the impact of file sharing, although some segments of the market, particularly the one for PC games, witnesses effects similar to the music industry. \n\n*The survey held among Dutch Internet users has shown that file sharing is here to stay and that people who download are at the same time important customers of the entertainment industry; therefore criminalising them makes no sense.','Policy implications include: \n\n*For a considerable amount of time, the industry remained unable to stem the tide of unlicensed music file sharing with their conservative strategy of abstaining from innovation, promoting legal measures against supposed offences and digital rights management. This strategy resulted in the current backlash, providing space for a new entrant establishing a major brand in the online music business: Apple\'s iTunes. \n\n*Reinvention of the business model looks like the only way out for the traditional players in the music industry. The music economy appears to be facing a shift in spending away from recordings to concert tickets and, to a lesser degree, merchandise. The advance of so called 360-degree artist contracts is a step towards greater diversification of sources of income and underlines the clear connection that exists between various revenue sources in different music markets: recordings, live music and merchandise. \n\n*The entertainment industry should step outside the box of the traditional value chain and venture into a host of other markets through the creation of value networks. \n\n*A strategy that focuses solely on lawsuits and digital rights management (DRM) is not the best response, in particular as it remains to be seen whether a fully authorised, paid-for downloading market would generate sufficient revenues to stay in business. Even in a hypothetical future without file sharing, a hybrid business model would appear to be the solution.\n\n*And so the entertainment industry will have to work actively towards innovation on all fronts. New models worth developing, for example, are those that seek to achieve commercial diversification or that match supply and end-user needs more closely. In such a context, criminalising large parts of the population makes no sense. Enforcement should focus on large scale and/or commercial upload activities.','http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1809696','https://ideas.repec.org/a/idt/journl/cs7703.html',0,0,0,'A representative survey of a sample of the Dutch population was conducted in April 2008.

Even older content that was not \"born digital\" can relatively easily converted to machine-readable formats. At same time, the world has become more networked, making it easy to transfer digital content from one person to another. The combination of technological progress in both digitization and computer networking has been a challenge for traditional ways of managing intellectual property. Some observers have even questioned whether current models for intellectual property can or should survive in a digital world. For example, there is widespread concern about piracy of popular music and film, both via the network and via bootleg CDs and DVDs. There is also concern about the economic viability of the current model for scholarly publication, or, for that matter traditional forms of publishing such as newspapers and TV network news. These developments have led to a revival of interest in the economics of copying and copyright. In this brief review we examine some of the economic issues in this area, and describe some of the insights that have emerged from this work. The article ends with some reflections on alternative business models for provision of creative works.','* If the copyright term is increased to T + Delta T, society loses the benefits from competition that would have accrued during the period T. On the other hand, extending the term makes the production of intellectual property more profitable, increasing the supply of works. The optimal term balances out these two effects. \n* A clever monopolist might use pre-emptive pricing and set an initial price low enough to discourage sharing. In the limit-pricing equilibrium, the surplus is shared between the monopolist and the consumer. This outcome is due to the fact that the possibility of sharing operates like a competitor for the monopolist, constraining the price that it can charge. Since the monopolist’s price and profit is increasing in the transactions cost of sharing, the monopolist would like these transactions costs to be as large as possible. Hence, it would be interested in seeing greater enforcement of antipiracy laws, technologies that make it costly to copy and similar measure that make copying more costly to consumers.\n* Now that most information is born digital and that digital information is typically very easy to copy and distribute, it is conceivable that copyright laws may become almost impossible to enforce. Some business models might help sellers supporting themselves in an environment without effective copyright: 1) Make the original cheaper than a copy; 2) Make a copy more expensive than the original; 3) Sell physical complements; 4) Sell information complements; 5) Subscriptions; 6) Sell a personalized version; 7) Selling works with digital fingerprints (encoding the identity of the purchaser); 8) Advertise oneself; 9) Advertise other things; 10) Monitoring; 11) Site licenses; 12) Media tax; 13) Ransom; 14) Pure public provision; 15) Prizes, awards and commissions\n- Copyright is a second-best solution to intellectual property provision. Perhaps the ultimate saving grace is that the same technological advances that are making digital content inexpensive to copy are also helping to reduce the fixed cost of content creation. Hundreds of thousands of people are giving away digital content, from blogs to garage video to open source software. The increased availability of content due to the reduction in the cost of creating and distributing it will presumably increase competition and reduce the price consumers pay for legitimate access to content.\n- It is highly unlikely that free content alone will meet all of society’s needs for content. However, free content together with some combination of the business models described in this work and traditional copyright may do an adequate job of satisfying society’s demand for information goods.','According to the author, since the monopolist’s price and profit is increasing in the transactions cost of sharing, the monopolist would like these transactions costs to be as large as possible.

Works existing in analogue form can now be easily digitised and therefore reused for different purposes and by different users. Industries, such as publishers, producers, broadcasters or information service providers are taking advantage of information technology by reusing analogue material in different ways. For instance, analogue material can be republished on the Internet websites, released on DVD or new compilations of old material can be produced. Also different cultural institutions can take advantage of the new opportunities opened up by digital technology. Museums, archives and libraries are involved in the digitisation of their collections of cultural and scientific material. In the case of the activities carried out by cultural institutions, the purpose of digitisation is often not only to preserve cultural and scientific material but also to provide users with access to their resources, including access online. To promote digitisation, online accessibility and preservation of digital material of cultural institutions, the European Commission launched the \"i2010: Digital Libraries\" programme1 in September 2005. Before digitising and further reutilising material that is still in copyright, the prospective user must often obtain consent from the copyright owner. The problem appears when it is impossible to find or locate right holders or when right holders remain unknown. This is the problem of so called ‘orphan works’. Where it is impossible to get suitable permission from the owner, digitisation and further exploitation of the material might not take place. Such a situation is to the detriment not only of the user, but generally speaking, of the public, as no-one profits from cultural material left unexploited due to its orphan status.   Discussions on how to deal with orphan works are currently being undertaken by stakeholders and cultural and collective management institutions at different levels and scopes. Some of them have been initiated by the stakeholders themselves, others by the European Commission or by Member States. Generally speaking, the aim of these discussions is to find a solution to facilitate the use of orphan material without prejudice to copyright. The eventual solution should provide legal certainty both to users and right holders, should the right holders reappear after the use of orphan works was made without their explicit consent.   The objective of this report is to give a general overview of the situation of orphan works in the European Union. The report describes possible legislative solutions to the issue, as well as main actions that are currently underway in this field.','*The system of extended collective licensing is not specifically tailored to orphan works but as its application is general, it can cover the problem of orphan works as well. The system applies automatically to all right holders in a given field, even unknown or untraceable. However in Europe, the ECL system functions only in few countries on a large scale. Although the Copyright Directive does not contain any provisions in relation to neither orphan works nor the management of rights, point 18 of its Preamble provides that the Directive remains without prejudice to any arrangements of Member States concerning management of rights, such as extended collective licensing.  \n\n*A model based on a non-exclusive licence is different as it requires the active role of an independent body which has the power to issue a non-exclusive licence. This system requires providing diligent search for the right holders prior to the use of orphan works and paying a fee. In the European Union only the UK law foresees the possibility of issuing a nonexclusive licence but the system has a relatively narrow scope. The UK Copyright Tribunal can issue consent for use of orphan works only in relation to sound recordings. On a large scale this system so far only applies in Canada. The Hungarian provisions that foresee a similar system are still under the form of proposal. It seems also, that Member States can legally introduce provisions establishing a mechanism of issuing a non-exclusive licence by an administrative or public body without prejudice to the Copyright Directive. \n\n*The third option, a model based on limitation or exception to copyrights, does not function for the moment in any legislation. The concept however, is similar to the ‘Canadian model’ in the sense that the user has to provide the diligence search prior to use. The main difference is that as the user could use the work under an exception to copyrights, there is no administrative body to control if the search for the right holder has been diligent enough and secondly, that the fee would be payable only after the reappearance of the right holder. This solution, for the moment, is not compatible however with EU legislation as the Copyright Directive does not foresee any possibility for Member States to introduce new exceptions or limitations to copyrights (the list of possible exceptions and limitations to copyrights in the Directive is exhaustive). That is why the solution of the UK would require changing the European copyright law prior to introducing a new limitation to copyright in UK legislation.  \n\n*The problem of orphan works is very complex, especially because of the cross-border aspect of digitisation and following the reuse of digital material. Still, the majority of countries in the European Union do not have any legislation concerning use of orphan works. Therefore it is essential that Member States should adopt a mechanism that will be interoperable in other countries within the EU with the ‘mutual recognition’ option.','*Although cultural institutions, collective societies and stakeholders undertake some actions, there is a growing expectation that some sort of mechanism should be introduced by Member States, especially since the Commission Recommendation recommends taking steps to introduce mechanisms or otherwise facilitate use of orphan works.\n\n*The idea is that once digitised and made available online in one Member State, after fulfilling commonly agreed principles and due diligence criteria for search of right holders, orphan works would be accessible in all other countries within the European Union. It is therefore essential that mechanisms adopted by Member States are interoperable and that there is a system of mutual recognition of adopted solutions between countries. In the case where Member States do not foresee to undertake any steps to create a mechanism for use of orphan works, it would not be possible to achieve interoperability within the EU. In such a situation it would be necessary to implement a mechanism enabling the use of orphan works at European level. This would require undertaking other actions in order to harmonise national solutions and provide Member States with a suitable mechanism for the use of orphan works.','http://ec.europa.eu/newsroom/dae/document.cfm?doc_id=6591','http://ec.europa.eu/newsroom/dae/document.cfm?doc_id=6591',1,0,1,'The information was submitted at the request of the European Commission in the form of questionnaires (first of June 2007 and second of November 2007), as a result of bilateral exchange of information between the European Commission and Member States and finally, in the MS final reports on the progress in the implementation of the Commission Recommendation which MS had to submit by the end of February 2008.'),('Von_Hippel_and_Von_Krogh_(2003)','Von Hippel and Von Krogh (2003)','http://www.copyrightevidence.org/evidence-wiki/index.php/Von_Hippel_and_Von_Krogh_(2003)',2003,'Open source software and the “private-collective” innovation model: Issues for organization science.','Currently, two models of innovation are prevalent in organization science. The “private investment” model assumes returns to the innovator result from private goods and efficient regimes of intellectual property protection. The “collective action” model assumes that under conditions of market failure, innovators collaborate in order to produce a public good. The phenomenon of open source software development shows that users program to solve their own as well as shared technical problems, and freely reveal their innovations without appropriating private returns from selling the software. In this paper, we propose that open source software development is an exemplar of a compound “private-collective” model of innovation that contains elements of both the private investment and the collective action models and can offer society the “best of both worlds” under many conditions. We describe a new set of research questions this model raises for scholars in organization science. We offer some details regarding the types of data available for open source projects in order to ease access for researchers who are unfamiliar with these, and also offer some advice on conducting empirical studies on open source software development processes.','* There are many interesting puzzles in open source software research projects that can trigger the interest of organization scholars for years to come. Answering some of them might even lead to substantial rethinking of the very concept of \"organization for innovation\" and a better understanding of innovation among distributed users who derive utility from freely revealing their information-based innovation to produce a collective good. \n\n* Most open source projects are hosted on a few major sites like Sourceforge.net.\n\n* Records of what is “committed” to the official code and by whom, is recorded in a publicly accessible Concurrent Versioning System (CVS) log.

For the EU Commission','In the context of the digital libraries initiative, the Commission has pointed out that the digitisation and online accessibility of cultural content require appropriate measures when dealing with orphan works i.e. material still in-copyright but whose right holders cannot be identified or located. In the recently released Communications \"Europeana – next steps\"  and \"Copyright in the knowledge economy\"  the Commission indicates that it will examine the orphan works problem in an impact assessment, which will explore a variety of approaches to facilitate the digitisation and dissemination of such works.\n\nIt is hard to establish reliable figures on the amount of orphan works, because at the moment there is no easy way to establish that a work is orphan. Hence, very little systematic research has been done and hardly any empirical data has been available about problems related to orphan works. The orphan works issue has been extensively analysed by the Copyright Subgroup within the High Level Expert Group on Digital Libraries, appointed by the Commission in 2006. A consolidated Final Report was published in December 2009.\n\nTherefore, as a complement to the past work and in order to gather as much empirical evidence as possible on orphan works in terms of 1) the dimension of the problem and 2) of the time and resources involved in efforts for clearing rights, the Commission carried out a fact finding mission in December 2009. A request for information was sent to 17 representatives of cultural institutions who had previously been involved with digitisation of cultural materials (such as British Library, Institut National de l\'Audiovisuel and Deutsche Nationalbibliothek). The letter was also distributed via mailing lists of library organisations such as the LIBER and CENL. Attached to this assessment is a list of the recipients. All together the Commission received 22 responses. Several of them included comprehensive tables and statistics about key issues reflecting the above questions and a description of concrete situations. Considering the difficulties in demonstrating the dimension of orphan works in concrete figures within digitisation projects around Europe, the received materials have been useful to illustrate the difficulties faced by cultural institutions when trying to clear the rights involved in the digitisation and online accessibility of protected content in their collections, particularly orphan works.\n\nThis analysis gathers the experiences of this fact finding mission as well as the figures included in other governmental fact finding initiatives, such as the US Report on Orphan Works and the Gower\'s Review, both of 2006, and the more recent Digital Britain, © The way ahead and In from the Cold reports, all of 2009. The results of the ACE Study (European Film Archives association) of 2010 about the amount of orphan works in film archives across Europe is also reflected in this paper. The status of national initiatives regarding solutions to the orphan works issue in various Member States was examined in February 2008. Some EU countries had already taken steps to develop a specific solution for the orphan works issue. The most advanced in this area are Denmark and Hungary. Denmark had chosen to strengthen their system of extended collective licences widely applied also in the rest of the Nordic countries, while Hungary opted for a centrally-granted non-exclusive licence solution. In addition, several Member States such as the UK, Germany and France are considering solutions varying from limitations to the exclusive rights of the authors, to the use of mandatory collective licensing, or so called extended collective licensing.\nIn order to solve this issue in a coherent way for all the EU, steps to propose legislation in this field need to be taken urgently.','The results of the study showed that there were a high number of Orphan Works across the Cultural Institutions. Orphan works form a significant part of any digitisation project and the survey shows high percentages of orphan works for almost all categories of works, especially among photographs, and audiovisual materials. \nThe study also found that transaction costs for clearing rights were expensive. Important information was collected also about the experiences as well as concrete costs involved in the rights clearance processes of cultural institutions. This information shows that rights clearance is costly and cumbersome for these institutions. In fact, the amount of time and effort to obtain licenses to digitise works has overwhelmed many of them. Data shows that the older the work and the less economic value it has, the more it costs to clear rights to use it.','A large number of digitisation projects has been analysed for this report, and the findings indicate clearly that there are considerable amounts of orphan works in collections of cultural institutions around Europe. This assessment should not, however, be considered as a comprehensive analysis of the situation concerning orphan works because extensive research has not been carried out in this topic.\nThe figures in the report only illustrate the dimension of the problem without implying any particular policy decisions. However, the report is meant to provide solid and reliable raw material for a fully-fledged impact assessment of the issue of orphan works aimed at considering concrete solutions to remedy the issue in the digital environment, as announced in the Commission Communication on Copyright in the Knowledge Economy.','http://www.ace-film.eu/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/Copyright_anna_report-1.pdf','http://www.ace-film.eu/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/Copyright_anna_report-1.pdf',1,0,1,'The Commission sent requests for information to 17 representatives of cultural institutions that had previously been involved with digitisation of\ncultural material.

Our examination was based on case studies of six different AHRC-funded projects: three funded under the Digital Transformations theme, and three funded by one of the Knowledge Exchange Hubs for the Creative Economy, Research and Enterprise in the Arts and Creative Technologies (REACT). To study the six cases, we conducted semi-structured interviews with selected participants from each of these funded projects. We used this empirical data to address the following research questions: (1) How do researchers engage with copyright during the research process and in the production of creative works, and what copyright related challenges emerge? (2) How is researchers’ engagement with copyright affected by digitisation, collaboration, legislation, and government policies? (3) Does copyright provide benefits to researchers as they undertake publicly funded research? (4) What range of works is produced during research, what do researchers identify to be of value in their projects, and can any of the benefits provided by copyright be mapped onto these values?','* Consistent with the existing, albeit limited, empirical research on copyright exceptions, researchers find the existing laws to be challenging in practice. \n\n* Authors found that researchers faced a variety of challenges in negotiating access to and the use of out-of-copyright materials in archives. \n\n* While economic benefit potentially arises from exploiting copyright in the outputs of research, neither academic researchers nor creative industry partners were interested in this direct benefit.  Of much more importance was the benefit that could be derived from asserting the right to be identified as an “author” of the output.\n\n* There was value for all case study participants to be derived from the collaborative research processes.','* Further case study research should be carried out with research projects that use a range of third party copyright-protected material (literary, dramatic, musical and artistic) to ascertain whether the copyright exceptions, as amended, help them to meet their research aims.  \n\n*Case study analysis should be carried out to determine the impact of copyright on research design, project implementation, and display of outputs, and whether the quality and value of research outputs is diminished where researchers have to make compromises in accessing or using rights-protected works (for example, when content or findings are not fully accessible to the public).  Case study research should be conducted across a range of funded projects to ascertain if the rules in the amended Re-Use of Public Sector Information Directive (latest implementation date 18 July 2015) are operated as intended, and if they do benefit researchers.  Relatedly, clear policy guidelines should be developed for libraries, archives and museums.

If they are, how might these art forms best be protected by cultural policy and cultural economics? These were the key questions that we set out to investigate with the support of a Beyond Text grant from the Arts and Humanities Research Council and with the help of our network members where together we formed an interdisciplinary team comprised of experts in copyright law, cultural policy, cultural economics, dance and musical composition. Through a series of interviews with musicians, singers, songwriters, composers, dancers, choreographers and others involved in the music industry and dance community we came to the conclusion that these types of works are both before copyright and beyond copyright. They are before copyright because what matters to the majority of those involved is the process of creation – which itself is constantly evolving – rather than the product – the protected work once fixed. They are beyond copyright because key aspects of the performance involve contributions which are not recognised by copyright, and because there is much about the performance which simply cannot be captured in the mechanical sense. As a result, policy intervention, which focuses on the product rather than the process, becomes problematic. This article suggests a series of practical recommendations made by our interviewees for ways in which the art forms may be supported into the future.','* In dance, there is much about both the process and the performance that interviewees think cannot be captured. For music, the process is also crucial. A key issue is to find something “extra” that will draw a life audience. \n* Because of a lack of resources, there is much contemporary music and dance that will not be captured, as it lacks a market. Once it is captured, then if the work is of a recognized kind, it will be accorded copyright protection. \n* A performer, on the other hand, is recognized as a performer in the absence of a performance being fixed. The lower parameters of the right accorded to performers, both unfixed and once fixed, which protects only the fixation itself and not the underlying performance against copying, seems much more suited to music and dance subcultures than does copyright with its expansive property right. The drawback is that performers’ income streams in respect of a performance are significantly lower by comparison with copyright owners’.\n* On an individual level, our interviewees generally live in a culture of precarious production. The overwhelming majority had ‘portfolio careers’. In other words, they could not live by their art alone, but rather had to seek out other income streams. These included commercial work for third parties and, rather often, teaching. Public funding (e.g. via various arts agencies) was important for survival, although the constant need to fill application forms and justify the works could detract from the production of the work and this was not seen as a long-term strategy, more of an occasional help for a specific project.','* An unresolved question is whether increases in rights (such as the extension of protection for sound recordings) would actively be detrimental to the interests of experiential, experimental musicians and dancers172 or indeed, whether the intellectual property framework, as currently conceived, is itself damaging.\n* We need to develop an understanding of creative processes and outputs that is both before and beyond copyright. The creative process prior to fixation is of prime importance and is thus before copyright; and there is much about a performance that defies fixation or is of the kind not recognised by the criteria required for copyright protection, and is thus beyond copyright.\n* Going forwards, and in a time of stretched public funding, knowing where to target limited resources for maximum return is going to be of vital importance. Appreciating that increased or even existing protection by copyright is of only marginal importance to experiential, experimental forms of music and dance, and that other initiatives might have a greater impact in supporting the art forms, opens the terms of debate as to what new strategies of targeted support might be developed.',NULL,'http://hdl.handle.net/10036/3357; https://ore.exeter.ac.uk/repository/handle/10036/3357',0,0,0,'Primary data include information gathered during a dancers focus group in London with interviews conducted on various performers.

The files available at YouTube include a mix of user-generated video and clips from network television shows. Networks fear that availability of their clips on YouTube will depress television viewing. But unauthorized clips are also free advertising for television shows. As YouTube has grown quickly, major networks have responded by making their content available at their own sites. This paper examines the effects of authorized and unauthorized web distribution on television viewing between 2005 and 2007 using a survey of Penn students on their tendencies to watch television series on television as well as on the web. The results provide a glimpse of the way young, Internet-connected people use YouTube and related sites. While I find some evidence of substitution of web viewing for conventional television viewing, time spent viewing programming on the web - 4 hours per week - far exceeds the reduction in weekly traditional television viewing of about 25 minutes. Overall time spent on network-controlled viewing (television plus network websites) increased by 1.5 hours per week.','- The empirical literature on file sharing in music and movies has, for the most part, found depressing effects of web distribution on legal sales. This study too finds significant depressing effects of web distribution on conventional television viewing, but it also documents largely offsetting positive relationships, reflecting complementarity. \n\n- Overall, conventional television viewing is reduced slightly in this sample, while overall viewing of network programming rises substantially. Hours spent viewing television programming overall nearly double with web distribution. While conventional television viewing falls by about 5 percent, this is more than offset by increases in time spent viewing network-authorized web programming.\n\n- The networks’ own web distribution has smaller but similar effects as the \nunauthorized distribution on conventional television viewing. Of course, in the network efforts, the network broadcasts advertising, so the loss the traditional viewing is at least partially offset by online ad revenue.','The authors recommend wider-scale sampling for determining typical effects of web distribution of television programming on television viewing - the population selected for this research (media users on a college campus) is adequate for the study given its intense computer use, but it\'s not representative of the US population generally.','http://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/6586822.pdf','http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0167624508000723',0,0,0,'The data for this study come from a survey administered on the campus of the \nUniversity of Pennsylvania in May 2007.

Using two new surveys of University of Pennsylvania undergraduates in 2009 and 2010, we ask how music file sharing and sales displacement operate in the iTunes era, when the alternative to file sharing is purchasing individual songs, rather than entire albums. We find large amounts of file sharing in this population. Respondents have more stolen than paid music, but the music obtained via file sharing is, for the most part, low-valuation music which the respondents would likely not have purchased. The rate of sales displacement implied by the relationship between stolen and purchased music across respondents in both samples is between −0.15 and −0.3. That is, an additional song stolen reduces paid consumption by between a third and a sixth of song.

This paper assesses the quality of new recorded music since Napster was established in 1999. First, I create an index of high-quality music from critics’ retrospective lists. Next, I rely on music sales and airplay data, using the idea that if one vintage’s music is better than another’s, its superior quality should generate higher sales or greater airplay through time, after accounting for depreciation. I find no evidence of a reduction in the quality of music released since 1999, and the two usage-based indices suggest an increase since then.

The Moderating Effect of Idolatry','Due to the development of information technology, music piracy has become an escalating problem. This study attempts to employ the theory of planned behavior (TPB) and the social identity theory to investigate the antecedents of downloading pop music illegally from the Internet, the relationship between the intention to illegally download music and the intention to buy music, and the moderating effects of idolatry. Data were collected from 350 teenagers in Northern Taiwan through questionnaire interviews conducted in city centers where teenagers gather. The results of partial least squares (PLS) analyses reconfirm the explanatory power of the TPB model with regard to the pop music illegal downloading behavior. However, it is interesting to note that the intention to illegally download music does not have a significant influence on the intention to buy music. This finding contradicts our common intuitions. Further analyses also reveal that idolatry moderates the relationship between the intention to illegally download music and the intention to buy music. For teenagers with high idolatry, a higher music downloading intention results in a lower buying intention. One possible explanation is the price of music CDs. Several interviews were also held to verify our results. Implications and a discussion are then provided.','* Results show that “attitude to illegally download music,” “subjective norms,” and “perceived behavioral control” are significantly positively related to “intention to illegally download music.”\n* Further, the relationship between “intention to illegally download music” and “intention to buy music” is not significant. This implies that the intention to illegally download music does not necessarily suppress the individual’s intention to buy CDs. This contradicts the claim that music downloading decreases CD sales, thus implying the importance of the moderating effect of idolatry.\n* Finally, “idolatry” is significantly positively related to the “intention to buy music.” When the moderating effect of “idolatry” is high, downloading behavior decreases teenagers’ buying intention.','* Attitude to illegal music downloading and significant others’ influences would affect intention to illegally download music. Therefore, building a negative attitude to illegal music downloading and creating a consensus among peers is one of the methods to prevent piracy. Strengthening teenagers’ understanding of copyright and ethical education is another possible solution. \n* If the music industry cannot meet teenagers needs in buying licensed music CDs, they may resort to acquiring music through illegal channels. \n* Young people have very high price elasticity of demand for music since they are usually economically dependent.

Given the complexity of the issues, this study argues for a spatial, network and process-oriented theoretical framework.','* As a result of both the regulatory and theoretical fractures, piracy offers some of the most interesting and intricate insights into matters of control, space and the global economy.\n* Though piracy has cut into the profit margin of the Hollywood majors, it has also reinforced Hollywood dominance in global image markets by circulating Hollywood products and consequently cultivating and creating an environment and demand for more of these products.\n* Piracy challenges some aspects of the state power such as law enforcement but helps in others in that it creates employment, contributes to tax revenue and provides entertainment for \'an increasingly anxious public in a society in transition\'.\n* Digital technology has increased consumer sovereignty.\n* Issues of piracy have highlighted the central, indispensable and indeed highly intricate roles the state plays in negotiating on the one hand with international trade regimes and transnational corporations, and on the other with piracy networks.','* China provides an example of the shifting nature of relations between powerful entities and those engaged in piracy\n* It also demonstrates the fluidity of network (including national) boundaries evident in the shadow economy of piracy  \n* China has been designated a source of economic loss for the Copyright industries of the USA\n* China has signed up to the TRIPS Agreement and other international treaties but the high levels of piracy indicate the power imbalance of using these top down methods alone to control piracy\n* Reasons for buying pirated films are varied and include lack of legitimately available films, or available films of high enough quality, or on the right technological format \n* Windowed release strategies are creating an incentive to buy pirated films by stemming supply',NULL,'http://tcs.sagepub.com/content/20/4/97.short',1,0,1,'This is a study examining piracy in China.

The paper is not intended to be a full literature survey, but rather attempts to identify the main areas that have been studied, and to offer an overview of what the literature says by means of an analysis of representative publications. The principal objective is to attempt to provide guidance to economists interested in undertaking empirical research on the economics of copyright, particularly in developing countries and countries with economies in transition. I shall attempt to provide an identification of areas for further research and suitable methodological approaches that could be followed by economists, especially in developing countries and countries with economies in transition, to study the economics of copyright empirically. To that end, the paper will address the following general topics: (1) papers dealing specifically with supply side effects (earnings from copyright royalties, the effect of copyright law on creativity, collective management of copyright); (2) papers dealing specifically with demand side effects (willingness to pay by consumers of copyright products, copyright infringement or piracy); (3) papers concerning emerging mechanisms for exercising rights over protected works. The paper concludes with a section that addresses directly the issue of copyright for developing countries.','* Firms tend to employ different appropriability mechanisms. Sometimes they do it sequentially – e.g. an invention is protected by secrecy at a early stage and later on is patented – and at other times simultaneously – e.g. because an invention comprises many elements that can be protected through different appropriability tools.\n* Lead time and secrecy seem to be the most relevant appropriability devices for most sectors and innovation types. Manufacturing and marketing capabilities – an appropriability mechanism which is not always considered in the studies surveyed – also provide a very relevant tool for protecting innovations.\n* Large firms have a higher propensity to patent and they judge patents as a more effective appropriability method than do SMEs. However, this does not necessarily mean that, once they decide to apply for patents, they have more patents than SMEs (since some studies show that larger firms have more patents than patenting SMEs, while others fail to find that result).\n* Although patents are not the most effective method for protecting innovations, many firms employ them anyway, be it jointly with other appropriability methods or not only as a means to protect their innovations but to achieve other objectives – i.e. “strategic patenting” (patent blocking, prevention of suits, reputation enhancing, cross-licensing, attracting venture capital, etc.).\n*  Disclosure and ease of inventing-around are the most important reasons for not patenting.\n* Patents are more relevant as an appropriability mechanism for product than for process innovations and for some sectors such as chemicals (especially pharmaceuticals), some machinery industries and biotechnology.\n* SMEs that display aggressive patent strategies often do not have the intention of exploiting their inventions but aim to license or sell them, among other factors, because they lack the production and marketing capabilities (complementary assets) needed for successfully commercializing these inventions.\n* There seem to be “patenting clubs” among manufacturing firms. That is, firms that have more patents and/or perceive patents as an effective appropriability device, tend to have higher patent propensities – in other words, patenting decisions would be related to the firm’s patenting history and its perception of the strength of patents as a protection tool.','This paper reviews the empirical literature on the use of appropriability strategies, including the determinants of the propensity to patent, with a view to highlighting the main findings.

However, a very important aspect of the value chain has\nbeen largely ignored-the fact that between creation and consumption, many contracts are likely to be involved, and copyright will, logically, have effects upon the way those contracts are written and interpreted. It is interesting that economists themselves have not put the issue of contracts into the forefront of the economics of copyright, since certainly the study of contracts and the incentives that they create is of primordial interest to economists generally.\n\nThis Article reviews the scant economics literature that does deal with the relationships between the legal institution of copyright and the contracts that are then written along the value chain. It is to be emphasised that this Article only deals with the economic theory literature, and does not consider the legal literature. The principal objective is to clearly identify the research gaps that exist, and to gain some perspective on the question of how these gaps might be prioritised in terms of importance or urgency.','Main research gaps identified by the study:\n\n*The economic theory profession has not considered in any detail the relationship between the legal institution of copyright and the types of contracts that are written along the value chain for copyrighted goods.\n\n*The topic of contracts has been looked at mainly in terms of royalty contracts, and then only really between creators and intermediaries (e.g., publishers, distributors, etc.)\n\n*An important research gap is to consider exactly how alterations in copyright protection (either some measure of enforcement, or perhaps some measure of scope, or of course the duration of copyright) would affect the terms that would be agreed to via royalty contracts.\n\n*The question of exactly how certain changes in copyright would end up affecting the welfare of the signatories to royalty contracts, thereby altering the balance of revenue flows and incentives, is of great interest.\n\n*Another important research gap would involve the explicit consideration of the perceived \"fairness\" of copyright contracts to the parties involved, and how (or indeed if) copyright law can be altered so as to ameliorate any perceived\nunfairness. \n\n*It would be useful to consider whether copyright and contracts are always to be understood as complements, or whether they can also maintain a substitute relationship: contracts can work as devices that substitute for copyright law, at\nleast as far as the signatories to the contract are concerned. \n\n*The author suggests we should consider the nature of the substitute-complement relationship between copyright and contracts, and above all, to determine what the nature of the relationship depends upon (with transactions costs being the most logical element). \n\n*The issue of the study of the interrelationship between the contract space and the contracts that are written within it, and copyright law\'s parameters and interpretations, would also be a useful research gap to explore.\n\n*A more careful, methodological, and formal application of the principal-agent framework to the specific case of copyright constitutes the most logical first step forward for economists.','Policy Implications:\n\nOnce a clear idea has been achieved of the type of substitute-complement relationship between copyright and contracts that exists, at least for specific points along the value chain, then one can determine with much more authority the type of policy conclusion that is suggestive of how copyright law might be amended to provide the incentives for individuals to use contract terms as protection measures instead.',NULL,'http://heinonline.org.ezproxy.lib.gla.ac.uk/HOL/Page?handle=hein.journals/intpl18&id=175&collection=journals&index=journals/intpl',0,0,0,'This is a theory driven paper: there is no empirical data to describe.'),('Weatherall,_Webster_and_Bently_(2009)_3','Weatherall, Webster and Bently (2009)','http://www.copyrightevidence.org/evidence-wiki/index.php/Weatherall,_Webster_and_Bently_(2009)',2009,'IP Enforcement in the UK and Beyond: A Literature Review','Recent reviews and policy discussions of the various IP systems have consistently lamented the\nlack of hard data on the extent of the problem of infringement, what it costs and whom it affects,how firms respond, and how successful existing systems for IP enforcement are. \nThe review analyses IP infringement and informal and formal enforcement, leaving out a more traditional study of the relevant judgements (a small proportion of the whole universe of infringement and enforcement).

Through the introduction of federal legislation, the industry hoped to realize gains at the expense of the consumer of home taping equipment and media. The analysis presented here indicates that the independent effect of taping on pre-recorded music sales may not have been as high as the recording industry has claimed, so that consumers may end up paying more than their fair share toward the windfall.','It is still possible that a surcharge will be placed on sales of home taping equipment and media, as a follow-on from the aforementioned Mathias Amendment.

In contrast with much popular opinion, it is reported that intellectual property features more prominently in the business of small entrepreneurial firms than it does in the business of large, established mature firms. The intellectual property portfolios of technology firms of all sizes and ages exhibit a rich array of instruments in addition to patents for protecting technology, including trade secrets, trademarks and copyright, together with licenses to externally sourced technology. The intellectual property profiles of technology firms appear to be influenced by their context, organizational profiles and corporate goals and by the character of their technology.','* It is suggested that the development of an intellectual property strategy for a\ntechnology firm is heavily influenced by the firm’s context, its organizational profile, its\ncorporate goals and the character of its technology; and that this general principle applies\nto small and young firms at least as much as it applies to large and established firms.\n* Thus, the challenges of developing and implementing an intellectual property strategy—\nfor small and young firms as well as large and established firms—mirror those of\ndeveloping an overall business strategy or corporate strategy, in terms of both the\ncomplexity of the challenges and the contingencies that may come in to play.\n* A number of commentators and observers believe that the benefits of intellectual property\naccrue disproportionately to large established firms and that the costs (both direct costs\nand transaction costs) of obtaining intellectual property rights, and of appropriating\nbusiness value from them, work against the interests of small and medium sized\nenterprises.

The performance measure was based upon revenue-growth data collected from each firm, and the categories of intellectual property analysed included patents, trade secrets, trademarks, copyright and licenses to externally sourced technology. This study also found that the financial benefits of accumulating a strong intellectual property portfolio were enjoyed by technology firms regardless of whether they were strategically oriented towards R&D or strategically oriented towards the commercial production of products and services.','* In other words, there is statistically significant support for the proposition that the accumulation of IP by technology firms has a positive impact on their financial performance.

The positive contributions of IP to financial performance arise predominantly from the firms’ investments in patents, trade secrets and trademarks, rather than from their investment in copyright-protected items or from obtaining licenses to use technology from external sources.\n\n* Here is statistically significant support for the proposition that, insofar as the accumulation of IP by technology firms has a positive impact on their financial performance, the degree of this positive impact will be positively related to the degree to which the firms concentrate their efforts on research and development activities.

Our theoretical and empirical results imply that lax anti-piracy policies would make software producers better off (i.e., higher software sales because of network effects) in countries whose income inequality is moderate, but worse off in countries whose income inequality is severe. Therefore, policies against piracy should be strategically designed considering the non-linear effects of income inequality.','* National income has a negative and statistically significant effect on piracy rates across eight regression models.

In 2003 WIPO published common guidelines on carrying out such research throughout the world. This methodology outlines four groups of copyright industries, identified on the basis of their level of dependence on copyright material. It establishes a set of major indicators – contribution to GDP, employment and foreign trade, and lays out research standards and approaches. The WIPO guidelines were developed on the basis of best international practices by a group of renowned economists. The guidelines have been implemented in over 40 countries around the world and their improvement continues with the experience gained.','The results of the national surveys confirm the importance of copyright industries in the overall economic performance. Copyright industries are well connected with the rest of the economy and have an active presence in the economic cycle. In many countries, copyright industries are playing a more important role than some traditional industries. Creative industries performance is enhanced when stimulated by governments (economic freedom), the legal system (well established property rights) and the businesses environment (competitiveness,\ninnovation).\n\nNational studies confirm the applicability of the WIPO methodology in countries at various levels of development. Developed countries performance in terms of contribution to GDP is higher in core copyright industries, while the developing countries have higher contribution in the non-core industries. New studies that are being carried out across the world will enhance the analysis and the overview of the performance of the creative industries in the global economy.\n\nMore broadly representative sample to include a greater share of emerging and developed economies will strengthen the robustness of the analysis. The next steps could involve time series analysis, cluster/regional analysis, deeper examination of the relationships through a statistical model that would seek to disclose closer causal relationships between copyright industries performance measures and relevant explanatory variables.','The merit of further studies and deeper analysis of the copyright industries is in outlining the potential of copyright for development, the need of linking the implementation of a robust copyright regime to the achievement of development objectives.

Two characteristics of these communities set them apart from traditional online message-based communities such as online forums. First, users have no social ties before joining the community. Second, there is little or no \"verbal\" communication between users. This research investigates the structure and dynamics of online sharing communities using data collected from an IRC music channel from 2001 to 2006, covering all five years of the post-Napster age. We have collected more than three hundred million individual activities, capturing 0.05% of the global music sharing volume. We find that sharers are an essential part of the community and their activities have a dominant impact on the growth of the community. By contrast, free riders have two opposite impacts on sharer retention. More free riders in number make it more likely for a sharer to keep sharing, while more free rider activities discourage sharers from contributing. That is, the existence of free riders, despite the congestion caused by their download activities, does to some degree stabilize the community. Most previous literature examines the online community only from the aggregate level. Our study, nevertheless, distinguish the influence and behavior of different members in the community. Instead of paying only attention to the total number of users, our results suggest that understanding the impact of their core members is critical in investigating the dynamics and the sustainability of online sharing communities.','* In non-verbal sharing communities, there are two types of users, sharers and free riders. These two types of users have different roles in the community; sharers are the core part of the community, since the value of a community is in its resource, which is solely provided by sharers.\n* The disproportional network congestion caused by sharers’ own intensive use shows that sharers also contribute to negative network externalities of a community. Moreover, the more sharers are involved in a community, the more likely the sharers continue to contribute content.\n* Fee riders’ are at the exact opposites in retaining sharers; the more free rider download activities, the more likely a sharer will stop sharing. \n* Sharer size is responsible for both sharer gain and loss. The dual effect may be due to the fact that sharer size represents three conflicting community factors: total  resources available, sharer download (their own benefit), and congestion generated by sharers.','This study has several managerial implications:\n* For entrepreneurs, when designing non-verbal communities, the creator should encourage all types of users to join, even if some of them may not contribute any content—their mere existence will be a reason for potential contributors to join. At the same time, the community operator should carefully monitor free riders’ download activities, maybe to go as far as imposing an upper limit to free riders’ download volume or bandwidth, so as to ensure that the sharers’ downloads are smooth and not affected by the often excessive free riders’ traffic. To retain sharers, it is also helpful for the community to provide more features for sharers to interact with other users.\n* For people who need to evaluate non-verbal sharing communities such as investors, they should not only look at the total number of registered users in a community, but also different user types and their often conflicting forces.','http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=935004; http://www.business.illinois.edu/Working_Papers/papers/06-0109.pdf',NULL,0,0,0,'Large data set of  300 million individual activities in Internet Relay Chat (IRC) sharing channels from March 2001 to May 2006.'),('Xia,_Huang,_Duan_and_Whinston_(2012)','Xia, Huang, Duan and Whinston (2012)','http://www.copyrightevidence.org/evidence-wiki/index.php/Xia,_Huang,_Duan_and_Whinston_(2012)',2012,'To continue sharing or not to continue sharing?

In these networks, sharing files is completely voluntary, and there is no financial reward for users to contribute. However, many users continue to share despite the massive free-riding by others. Using a large-scale data set of individual activities in a peer-to-peer music-sharing network, we seek to understand users’ continued-sharing behavior as a private contribution to a public good. We find that the more benefit users “get from” the network, in the form of downloads, browses, and searches, the more likely they are to continue sharing. Also, the more value users “give to” the network, in the form of downloads by other users and recognition by the network, the more likely they are to continue sharing. Moreover, our findings suggest that, overall, “getting from” is a stronger force for the continued-sharing decision than “giving to.”','* A one standard deviation increase in variable of download leads to a 27% increase in the odds of continued sharing. Similarly, a one standard deviation increase of variables of browse, search, contribute, and been_browsed leads to a 23%, 33%, 32%, and 47% increase in the odds of continued sharing, respectively. Becoming a value use leads to a 146% increase in the odds of continued sharing. \n* Overall, the results show that both self-use and continuous contribution provide strong incentives for users to continue sharing. In addition, “getting-from” is a stronger force for the continued-sharing decision than “giving-to.”\n* Sharing history has a significant effect on users’ decisions to share across all models. The total number of files downloaded has a significantly negative effect on the sharers’ decision to continue sharing. \n* In a PTP network, both the user’s benefits received from the network and the value the user provides to the network are significant predictors of her continued contribution.

Their inverse relationships with piracy indicate that the increase of these three can bring down piracy. Consequently, the higher the standard of living, the higher the individualism, and the higher the level of ICT expenditure in an economy, the lower the piracy rate. \n* Because the results were significant and consistent across the six years of the survey, they results are generalizable: ICT has a strong explanatory power to alleviate piracy. Accordingly, increases in ICT have a powerful effect to reducing a country’s piracy rate.\n* This research confirms prior research that income per capita is the most influential factor on software piracy: a one thousand dollar increase in GNI per capita leads to the decrease in the piracy rate from between 0.6 and 1.01 percentage points. This variable alone explains between 59% and 74% of the variations in the rate of piracy across countries. \n* The inclusion of individualism alongside GNI per capita increased the explanatory power of the model by between 4 and 10%: a one unit rise in IDV index results in at least 0.194 percentage point fall in the piracy rate. This confirms previous findings that culture is a complementary factor that impacts software piracy, but perhaps a secondary factor compared to GNI.\n* A one percentage rise in ICT/GNI reduces the incidence of piracy by at least a 1.734 percentage point.

In this particular case, the extent of the young viewers’ activity (limited by consumer cultural ideologies) and the consequences of their activity (such as their transformation into active consumers with few counter hegemonic ideas) validate cultural imperialism theorists’ criticisms of the transnational corporate consumer culture and the diminishment of public spheres.','There is a need to refine the thesis of transnational corporate cultural imperialism in the context of audience activity, so that it both presents and theorizes the nuanced mediation between audience agency and structural power.','http://www.looooker.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/j.1753-9137.2010.01079.x1.pdf','http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1753-9137.2010.01079.x/full',0,0,0,'The data set is made up of semi-structured interviews with young viewers’ recruited through the author\'s social network in Beijing and Shanghai through\nthe method of snowball sampling on a single criterion —they must watch some U.S. television in their everyday lives.

These rationales were an accumulation of statements from pirates, prosecutors, and reporters’ commentaries on piracy issues. The three leading reason categories for condoning piracy were reducing monetary expenditures, justifications based on features of piracy processes, and deficiencies in law enforcement, each accounting for 43/252 (17.1%) of the cited rationales. \n\n*Of the 192 articles coded, 156 gave rationales against piracy providing 248 rationales. The leading reason category, capturing 132/249 (53.2%) of the citations, was the economic hardships that piracy causes for software producers.

One of the important factors to consider in policy formulation is the financial interests in database contents. A creator who invested in creating a database is interested in recouping the investment using the revenues that the database helps to generate. The revenues may be reduced when a free-riding reuser creates a competing database by extracting the contents from the creator\'s database. Thus, creators would like to have certain means of protecting the contents in their databases. Without adequate protection, the incentives of creating  such databases could diminish. On the other hand, overprotection can cause under-utilization of information and make downstream value-added data reuse costly or even impossible.
